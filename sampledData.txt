There’s your set up. Sonia is played by the Russian actress Kseniya Rappoport. She’s quite good in this role which calls for her to be somewhat haunted, mysterious, sexy, and there are other things about her that you can’t quite put your finger on.

The Great Gig In The Sky - Kirsty Rock (Pink Floyd)
and I really wish you did so you could help her.
Dr. Carl Maia (Antonio Moreno) discovers a fossilized hand in the Amazon and is blown away at how unlike anything else it is. He recruits ichthyologist David Reed (Richard Carlson) to go with him on an expedition. They set sail down the Amazon along with the Captain Lucas (Nestor Paiva), Dr. Reed’s girlfriend Kay (Julia Adams), his boss Dr. Mark Williams (Richard Denning), and colleague Dr. Thompson (Whit Bissell). There are also a couple of the boats crew members who exist solely to provide the film with a body count. They soon discover the titular Black Lagoon, which is home to the also-titular creature (Ben Chapman on land, Ricou Browning in the water). When the so-called Gill-Man is discovered, Dr. Reed wants to observe it in its natural habitat. Dr. Williams wants to capture it for fun and profit. Meanwhile the Gill-Man seems to have its sights set on Kay. Terror ensues.

I would furthermore say that by the failure of President Obama to have taken this step last month he has already violated his oath of office. One of the laws he is required to faithfully execute requires that he prevent the debt of the United States from being questioned. Yet by his inaction the debt of the United States is, right now, being questioned--and is being increasingly questioned more and more as time passes.Upyernoz / rubber hose: platinum, baby, platinum

We explored Bologna some more, continuing to escape the cold in little boutiques and art shops. We stumbled onto this church and decided to go in, and it is my favorite church that I have ever been in. The Chiesa di Bartolomea; it was free to get in, which is good as someone who travels as cheaply as possible, and I think it adds to the authenticity of the church. I feel like when you pay a bunch of money to go into a church it loses the sanctity. We were in here after dark and were literally the only two people there. The colors in the church were dark, and having the moonlight shinning in through the windows. It was amazing. A definite “must” for anyone going to Bologna.
Although the media releases, self-congratulatory press conference, and general atmosphere of trebles all round suggested that, in terms of lender haircuts, this is a done deal, it isn’t. Not a single bank has as yet signed a single piece of paper. The lenders are to be given 4 (that’s four, count them) options as to how they participate. These debt swaps and rollovers come in 15-30 year packages at lower rates than currently, some of which also vary between options. There is thus no way of knowing in advance how big the ‘haircut’ will be. There are these four ways to contribute because as well as being unable to offer the Troika any real relief, they squabbled amongst themselves – and eventually ran out of time. (Free-market capitalism, you see, is all about giving the customer choice).
A lot of the vegan scone recipes I looked at used olive oil or a butter replacement. I would definitely like to try it with olive oil next time, maybe in a savoury version of the scone with some fresh rosemary but I wanted this to be sweet. I went with coconut oil as my choice of fat as it has a slightly sweet coconut flavour and a buttery texture when it’s cold out of the jar. I wanted to see how it behaved in baking too. It turned out really well. You don’t miss the butter at all.
Ummm, not exactly.
Though the Dutch did not win the World Cup final this past weekend, they have succeeded in another area: enticing IP investment with strong tax incentives for companies undertaking R&D. Formerly known as the “patent box”, the recently-amended (as of January 1, 2010) “innovation box” is a tax benefit for Dutch owners of patents or other intangible assets for which a special R&D-qualification certificate has been granted. R&D expenditures are deductible from the general corporate income tax rate of 25.5%. However, once the losses and expenditures have been recouped, assets may be included in the innovation box, through which the tax rate on all corresponding profits, including through licensing, drops to 5%. As there is no cap on the amount of R&D asset profits that are eligible for taxation at the lower tax rate, you can even benefit from the innovation box if and when you sell an R&D asset for significant capital gains.

The IPKat has long wearily despaired that it is not apparently possible even today to read a news item relating to intellectual property in which the words “copyright”, “patent” and “trade mark” are used with their correct meaning. Dr Jaiya’s comments about IP being seen as an esoteric subject that is the exclusive domain of a small number of specialist practitioners therefore seem especially apt. Regardless of our individual affiliations, therefore, it is for all of us to play some part in raising the awareness of IP. This Kat therefore felt very privileged to be present yesterday and thanks all who worked so hard on making the event possible.

In one mob-attack by black township dwellers against a Free State police staton, the local ANC-MEC in charge of security ordered the cops to ‘use maximum force’; attacks against Afrikaners included the murder of Bloemhof farmer At van der Merwe on Apr 3; Heilbron farmer Christo van Rensburg who survived a molotov-cocktail attack on Apr 10; five Afrikaner families were kidnapped from their homes in one small suburb: Uitsig, Bloemfontein; Harrismith farmer Tjokkie Venter was stabbed in the face by illegal squatters on a government-owned farm; workers Chris Grobler and Eugene Lloyd survive an attack on a Kroonstad farm; and an ANC-official of the Sasolburg town council ran his car at breakneck speed at the popular Afrikaans singer Zak van Niekerk, killing him and critically injuring his friend;

Another key area is research and development. Companies that embrace R&D have a better chance of developing products and processes that set them apart and give them an edge in the competitive global and domestic marketplace. The dollar can help here as well, by enabling cheaper purchases of some of the sophisticated equipment and technology necessary for world-class R&D.

Last week, I wrote about how time can affect how we look upon a particular set. This week, I want to take note of how sets from the prior year (and the next year) affect our perception as well. For example, was 1991 Topps really that good of a set or was 1990 Topps so bad that it made it look that good? For that the answer could be both, but sometimes you really have to think about it. There are several instances of this phenomenon that pop up among the 61 (major) Topps sets and the next group of five will highlight a few of them. One follows a particularly memorable set, one comes before a memorable set, and one comes after a string of very forgettable sets.
The latest brouhaha in popular physics is, of course, the question of why there is something rather than nothing—a question that has pushed to the fore with Larry Krauss’s new book, A Universe from Nothing.

Since then, the principals have been sniping at each other, leaving folks like me a bit confused.

We started early today to make some time up from yesterday. On our way to Winchester we stopped for a few minutes in Arundel to take pictures of the castle we saw from the highway.

I particularly fell in love with a store called Cath Kidston, which sells a large variety of crafty, but rather expensive items.

Sound familiar? Now of course, nobody would’ve dared hope in August 2002 that we’d have a 3-time all-american defensive end in our midst. Could that be the case in 2009? (Answer: No.) At defensive end it’s impossible to overlook the history of Pollock, Will Thompson, Robert Geathers, et al, and equally impossible to overlook last year’s dismal performance at the position.

Aspartame is composed of three ingredients — two amino acids (phenylalanine and aspartic acid) and a methyl ester bond. In typical proteins like meat, fish or eggs, phenylalanine and aspartic acid comprise 4-5 percent each of the total amino acid profile. This is how nature intends the human body to encounter these two amino acids and there is nothing wrong with these substances if they occur naturally in a proper balance with other amino acids.
The truth is that while it is my training, it is the process and the tactile quality that I love. The sensation of stroking the marker across the page. Watching the image take dimension and shape. The art of rendering for me is almost like a ritual; sitting down with a drink in my studio, music playing, I select my colors, laying them out in order, take a moment to ponder my light source and then start. I find that my best work, comes when I'm relaxed, in the moment and not thinking too much. You can't rush rendering by hand. You have to go slow.

There’s room on the walls for far more than the fifty-some photographs on display from the golden age of Soul Train, at Expo 72 through September 5. And the gallery floor is mostly empty—there are just two table cases. One displays dolls and merchandise, the other photos, press clippings and a letter on WCIU-TV letterhead from Soul Train creator Don Cornelius, dated January 25, 1971, informing Charles Bayliss of 1316 South Kolin Avenue that he and his dancing partner were invited to perform on the show, so long as neither was “over dressed.” (The letter, and other items in the case, are from the personal collection of music writer and TOC contributor Jake Austen. An article by Sun-Times critic Ron Powers for the newspaper’s television listings, calling the show “that soul-shaking, scintillating, ex-CRU-ciating, mighty, mighty vehicle of rhythm and blues,” is a must-read.)
One thing I have found in these books though, is that telling a story in the first person does limit you in terms of the language. I find sometimes that I can’t use certain words or phrases because the character telling the story just wouldn’t use them. And that can be a little constricting at times. I have to try to work around that by having other characters say what he wouldn’t!

While we're on this topic, let me add that I believe the single worst thing to have happened during this commotion, and amounting to one of the worst things he's done, has been President Obama's insertion of his opinion into the matter. He clearly showed his bias, moreover when he was not even close to possession of the facts in the case, and stirred up an issue that can and may still lead to race riots. His statement was grossly irresponsible

Then we are faced with the problem of advancing technology.

Most of us buy the cheap quality CD’s and then don’t store them correctly in acid free and cool environments.

No, I’m not yet tired of Garron. I think (I hope) that he has changed and evolved since the first book. Here’s a guy who grew up in a tough, but not criminal, world with little education, and thought he’d got out through boxing. When that didn’t work, he found he had no other skills. His decisions are driven by his circumstances and in some cases by self-deception about his own motives. He’s an introspective character and in fact the first book was really written not as a thriller, but as a character study, though set in a world with thugs and guns in it. He’s been described as a ‘tough guy’ character, but I don’t really think of him like that. A lot of thriller lead characters are called tough guys, but he’s not a 6 foot 4 ex-special services marine, with three black belts in martial arts, who can make a flame thrower out of an empty washing up liquid bottle and some sticky-back plastic. It takes more to be tough when you’re not sure what’s going to happen, or whether you can deal with it, or if in fact whether you should try dealing with it at all.

This is a season when you will no longer stretch up as on your tiptoes to try to understand revelation or to see and discern as an external exercise. Rather, you will become one with Me as I am one with My Father, and you will know spiritual reality-not as something to be received or attained, but as a result of being joined to My heart. It will be the overflow of intimacy.
I think that Rakkofsky’s mishaps demonstrate why this rule makes good sense. His gripes essentially stem from a failure to receive important documents.

Imagine a rotten little cargo ship, bobbing in the Atlantic. The night’s been a dramatic one for all aboard, and it’s not yet dawn when they gather on-deck, disheveled, confused, and now blinded by a great light from above. It’s the glow from an immense luxury liner, several storeys tall and dwarfing their craft. Row after row after row of wealthy gawkers line its railings, looking down at the ship’s measly crew like spectators in the Coliseum. The crew, who’ve spent nearly two hours of film-time scuttling through the bowels of their ship, committing debaucheries and big betrayals, seem minor now, as do the stakes they struggled over. Their debaucheries were petty; their betrayals netted tiny gains. Those of us in the audience knew it all along, and now the people aboard this luxury liner—an audience within the film—know it too. They stand in for us.

The Vice Chairman of the CFR is Richard E. Salomon, a senior advisor to the Jesuit cohort David Rockefeller (Who you tell me is SMOM). He is Chairman of the Advisory Board of Blackstone Group. Blackstone Group is run by Peter G. Peterson and Stephen A. Schwarzman. Peterson is married to Joan Cooney, who has received honorary degrees from two Jesuit institutions (Boston College and Georgetown University) and whose mother was Catholic. Peterson co-founded the Concord Coalition along with Warren Rudman, who was Jesuit-trained at Boston College. Peterson was also a crony of Jesuit-trained Bill Clinton. As for Stephen Schwarzman, Schwarzman was a member of Skull & Bones (Which is really the Vatican’s Papal Knights of Eulogia) and he celebrated his 60th birthday on February 13, 2007. One of his friends who attended the party was Cardinal Edward Egan. So, we can see that both of the men running the Blackstone Group, which Saloman had close ties to, are Jesuit coadjutors.

The lemurs like hanging out around the visitors lodge. Most documentaries try to keep the reserve’s buidlings out of the shot, to create the feel of a natural wilderness - that has sadly been lost.
Not for me. I wanted to buy. However, I had two items in mind – a new mini stereo system to replace the dud that died in January after just over two years of “service,” and a pair of “good jeans” to replace the pair now sporting rips and holes. True, I was thinking of my Mom’s and my trips downtown as I rode the streetcar there and walked through the Eaton Centre (definitely not there back in the day). But successfully purchasing the two items needed without hitting more than one store (Sears, if you want to know. I didn’t even enter The Bay which now sits on the old Simpson’s store). Even the sprinkling of rain on the way home didn’t dampen the expedition. I just opened my umbrella and held it over the box containing the stereo.
Knowing our penchant for quick fixes, schools from Fargo to Florida will probably start requiring kids to lace up their own skates. But wouldn’t it be amazing if parents started letting their kids walk to school again? If only because it’s good for their kids’ SAT scores? — Lenore

I tried writing the alphabet with my left hand...then a complete paragraph. It's mind blowing how perfectly well I know how to write letters and form words, and how idiotic and elementary my handwriting looked when I was finished. I would have guessed it was written by a 7 yr old if I hadn't written it myself. AND to make matters worse- I couldn't focus on the content of what I was trying to write because I was focusing so hard on HOW I was forming each letter and word. It was maddening. I will not be signing any checks, or sending cards with handwritten notes for a while after surgery. (unless I can sign the card as if it was from my 6 yr old nephew Asher :)
Bottom line: its intrusive and far from what I require as an online experience.

Tempers flare over the audacity of “US PEOPLE” coming in all of a sudden, out of the political woodworks hell bent on putting an end to all their warmongering, government growing, right stripping fun. Why can’t we just shut up and take a big slice of the status quo pie? Why can’t we be “realistic “and accept that the republican party would be thrusting itself on its own sword if they allowed Ron Paul to be the nominee? Look we’ve paid our dues, we’ve nestled our noses in places most unseemly in order to get where we are and by osh kosh ba gosh this is our last chance to become delegates and it’s not fair. It’s just not fair.

It made me look at how I had treated her son, at how The Man had viewed her son so differently than I had viewed him. It made me think about her daughter, so much like my own daughter, having to grow up without her mom. And how, as a mother she could so genuinely accept someone who had previously been cruel to her own son.
I'm working on a new oil painting, started yesterday. I feel like this one is making headway with my palette for the first time. I have been floundering around with the palette problems since I went back to painting with oils, but I seem to have gotten into a rhythm with this new painting. I don't know whether it is just a matter of time working on technique and color mixing or just getting back into the oil medium and settling in. One thing is that I have mostly left the cadmium yellows out of this painting, saving them for accents. I tend to do better with the ochre and earth colors which are my winter palette and this is a painting from a reference photo I took at Merritt Island Wildlife Preserve in January.

It tastes weird. Intense perfume pervades the whole thing and makes it hard to get at the beeriness beneath. I can just about detect the peat, and the roast barley is present on the finish. There's possibly a bit of chocolate buried in there too, but overall it's quite difficult to take. Still, I suppose when it's €10 for half a litre you don't want to be charging through it. I'm not at all sure I'd buy another bottle, and the price is only part of the reason.

The Bible is the Word of God; His revelation of Himself to man so that man can understand himself and his role in relation to his Creator. There are many men behind the pulpits of todays churches who quite frankly are false teachers, whether by intention, or ignorance, is not for me to judge, but the results are the same. Whenever and wherever people teach that God is love, and fail to teach that He is holy, just, and hates sin they are NOT teaching the truth as the Bible reveals it.

Reason #4 -- Religious beliefs make some people one-issue voters, or at least one-group voters. Otherwise, Sarah Palin, who is way out of her league, wouldn’t have energized so many people. They’re obviously not looking at her as a real leader: she’s a prom queen who happens to believe in a specific set of religious tenets. Perhaps there is this fanatical fantasy about turning the U.S. into some sort of idealistic Christian wet dream…never mind that this country was founded largely on religious tolerance and separation of church and state. The Republicans have pandered to the social right-wing of the party, which is as out-of-touch with the country at large as the social left-wing was in the late 70s and early 80s. The pendulum has swung, but a quarter of the country hasn't noticed and instead is frothing at the mouth at the possibility of fundamental Christianity as the law of the land.

I wrote in my journal after the bike trip to Austin that I had been profoundly changed by the experience, but at the time I couldn’t or didn’t verbalize how that was so. In the weeks afterward that change has taken much more form. The most obvious to most people is that I have lost over 50 pounds! Some have asked me what I did to accomplish that, and I have given different responses, but I guess the best answer is that it was just the right time.

My great-aunt Dora Lillie Mahler died on June 9, 1950, and her life and death remain a mystery. She was living in a nice area of the Bronx with her mother, Tillie, at this time...and possibly with her widowed sister Henrietta Mahler Burk, whose husband Isaac Burk had died unexpectedly in 1943. (Henrietta and Isaac were my paternal grandparents.)
I think it’s safe to say that we didn’t really learn anything. SJSU was clearly out manned and Alabama was never really tested. CJ Mosely looks like he’s got some talent and McCarron did a pretty decent job as well. So, in that regard I guess we learned that we have some talent in reserve, but I think we were all pretty clear on that anyway. Let’s all agree that the Spartans amounted to a pre-season scrimmage game that actually counts on the record.

Yep, they’ll be the very first family to try out that prototype like a high-tech Loud family. Each member in his or her own internet glasses that allow you to take your laptop screen literally everywhere with you, about a centimeter from your face, as they blissfully bump into every last goddamned thing.

Add to the angst that I've lost 5 pounds, and I have a weekend of eating out ahead of me. I feel pretty confident at this point that I can be sensible, but I worry that I'll lose my mind and go rogue with a hot fudge sundae. Or lemon merengue pie. Mmmmmmm.... wait, where was I? Oh - so you see that if dessert's on the agenda I'll have to excuse myself, go up to my room, and take a shower or something.
I say this not because I would teach that worldly rulers ought not be Christians, or that a Christian cannot bear the sword and serve God in temporal government. Would God they were all Christians, or that no one could be a prince unless he were a Christian! Things would be better than they now are and the Turk would not be so powerful. But what I would do is keep the callings and offices distinct and apart, so that everyone can see to what he is called, and fulfill the duties of his office faithfully and with the heart, in the service of God. Of this I have written more than enough elsewhere, especially in the books On Soldiers and On Temporal Government. For Paul will not suffer it that in the Church, where all should be Christians, one assume another’s office ( Romans 12:4 and Corinthians 12:15), but exhorts every member to his own work, so that no disorder arise, but everything be done in an orderly way. How much less, then, is the disorder to be tolerated that arises when a Christian leaves his office and takes upon him a temporal office, or when a bishop or pastor leaves his office and takes upon him the office of a prince or judge; or, on the other hand, when a prince takes up the office of a bishop and lets his princely office go? Even today this shameful disorder rages and rules in the whole papacy, contrary to their own canons and laws.
Yeah!
Eventually gravity had her way and head relaxed completely as well.
Meditation: Do you view God’s law negatively or positively? Jesus’ attitude towards the law of God can be summed up in the great prayer of Psalm 119: “Oh, how I love your law! It is my meditation all the day.” For the people of Israel the “law” could refer to the ten commandments or to the five Books of Moses, called the Pentateuch, which explain the commandments and ordinances of God for his people. The “law” also referred to the whole teaching or way of life which God gave to his people. The Jews in Jesus’ time also used it as a description of the oral or scribal law. Needless to say, the scribes added many more things to the law than God intended. That is why Jesus often condemned the scribal law. It placed burdens on people which God had not intended. Jesus, however, made it very clear that the essence of God’s law – his commandments and way of life, must be fulfilled.

The cuisine is continental, but more importantly, the beer list resembles the likes we have seen on better part of the continent, too. Food may be king here, but it is seldom to see such a well-chosen list of 32 beers in this country, including 4 Nøgne Ø's, 2 Atna beers and 9 suberb Belgians. The Norwegian macro beer establishment is represented by Aass, another good choice in my opinion. In terms of selection this place ranks third in the beer desert of Oslo, but when you add beer knowledge and service it may well be a contender for the gold medal.
There really isn't much more I can pray for in life, then for Sy to become a man of faith. All parents want their children to learn from their mistakes, to be better people, and I guess I'm no different.

I pray that when he feels life is just "stinky" that he can still find a reason to rejoice.

Perhaps the most detailed book available on the yogic meaning of the prime seed mantras and letters of the Sanskrit alphabet along with their application for body, mind and spirit. Unfolds secrets of how to use mantra with pranayama and many esoteric meditation practices. Examines the usage of mantras in all the main branches of Yoga (Hatha, Raja, Bhakti, Jnana), Tantra, Veda, Ayurveda, Jyotish and Vastu, as well as relative to Kundalini and the chakras and major Hindu deities. An excellent reference guide for years to come.

Its easy to see how the NACTs are lining up to grab Auckland. John Banks heads a list of rightwing NACT candidates for the new Council. The left is as yet not putting up a serious fight. Len Brown has come out in opposition to the sale of public assets but only because there has been no referendum on the sales. But even this poses a threat to a NACT victory, so the dirty tricks brigade is in full swing to destroy Len Brown. That is not helped by Len Brown's naivety and his weak campaign organisers.
And all our politicians are waiting for someone else to do something about it.

Only weak, pathetic little bullies need to try to restrict women’s sexual choices in order to feel like “real men”, but truly real men (the kind without scare quotes) aren’t threatened by sexually aware women; they are secure enough in their masculinity to recognize women have the right to control our own bodies and to decide whom we want to bestow our favors upon and for what reason. In short, only insecure sissies want to suppress women’s right to sexual self-determination; real men support the right of women to make our own sexual choices, including the decision to engage in sex work if we are so inclined.
The airport was damaged in the earthquake and is not yet back up to full capacity. Planes need fuel, but there’s very little available in Port-au-Prince, and it’s heavy and expensive to fly in. Airport staff are among the victims, and many will be digging their families out of rubble. The US army is reputed to be stepping in to manage the airport. A strict system to allow planes in and out of the airport will be established, placing an absolute ceiling on the physical volume of aid that can come in. In other words, it doesn’t matter how organized, prepared or resourced you are: there’s only one airport, and it can only process so much cargo a day.

And Jesus spoke more of Hell and warned more intently about Hell because of His love for us. Because He did not want anyone to choose it. Because He wants people to be free of the second death. And Jesus took it upon Himself, the curse of sin which is death, but He rose again overcoming death, so that we can be set free.
I sow the seeds in February previous year - in June they were big enough to replant them in separate pots. Some of them flowered and had few fruits. This spring is time to plant them in their containers – big, old wooden barrels. Last year, as I used to be the ornamental gardener, I would plant petunias or surfinias there, but this year I am drifting more and more into veggie gardening, the barrels have different guests. Strawberries will be growing on such a level, that it will be easy to pick the fruits and eat directly from the plant…

Gregorian calendar festivals became more rigid after the Reformation and by 1660 many previous celebrations which smacked of paganism were banned. One of these is worth resurrecting. In the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, before it was abolished, a ritual was held on Bride’s Feast Day the calendrical opposite of that held by all farming communities until the first European War of creating the harvest corn dolly which was carried round the fields to bless the harvest.

BODACIOUS SPACE PIRATES: The Japanese title is MOURETSU PIRATES, or Moupai in short. Actually, it’s based on a novels series titled MINISUKA PIRATES. Both the anime and the novels titel would suggest a hentai story (minisuka referring to miniskirt and moupai sounding similar to oppai – breasts). But I’ve heard it’s suprisingly different and good. Can’t quite think of in what way or how the story should go (female pirates in space?!?) but EXACTLY the reason why I’m so curious!

When I graduated from middle school, I applied for the special school, and was denied. My grades were not up to their standards, so they would not be allowing me to attend. I was pissed to say the least; I found my classes boring, and easy. I slacked off because I already knew what my teachers had to say, and my grades reflected it. I talked to my school counselor about it. She and I had become fairly friendly over the years, having been in her office multiple times, for not getting along with other students. She understood my problem, and offered to help me re-apply with her recommendation, and I contacted my old teacher for another recommendation. The school decided that I was at least worth interviewing, and allowed me to come and discuss why I belonged in their school. I must have done well because they accepted me on the spot.

But my point here in remembering Joiner here is not his greatness but his timing -- even though he never has a season where he led the league in receptions, yards or receiving touchdowns (and never really came all that close), made only one All-Pro team and was often, even in his best years, the second or third best receiver on his own team (behind Kellen Winslow, Wes Chandler or John Jefferson), he was inducted in the Hall of Fame in 1996, in part because of his amazing consistency and durability (he played 18 years), and in part -- I would say -- because he held the record for most receptions and receiving yards when he retired.
People choose to be in relationships for various reasons. I don’t know how many people ask themselves these questions before deciding to commit to someone. Granted someone people are the dating type, others are the relationship type. I am an advocate for dating. I can get to know you without committing to you. High school confuses this. Boy likes girl, girl likes boy, they go together. In the adult world, not so much. Chances are you aren’t spending 8 hours a day getting to know this person before you become an item. You probably don’t see them at lunch. In your adult life, you must date, then be courted.. there’s a difference.. in my book anyway.

Particularly challenging are micing live acoustic instruments, like acoustic pianos, and getting enough volume without feedback in a full band environment. I must admit that I was initially skeptical that the mics would either pick up too much and be unusable or that they would distort or clip due to high sound pressure levels. I was surprised to find that we were able to achieve both great sound quality and volume from DPA’s SMK4061 stereo mic kit with no clipping or distorting.
Lastly, I wanted a quick word on the cover. The top version is the final used on the print edition, but I prefer the version below used on the review copy I got from BEA, which shows the train and Mercy looking quite determined.

I know this is going to date me, but I might as well be honest: when I started university, back in (gasp!) the late 1980s, I brought an electric typewriter to school with me. We did have a computer at home—a state-of-the-art 386 PC that ran on MS-DOS—but my dad, himself a university professor, thought I could get by with the typewriter for at least my first year. By second year I had one of his cast-offs, a behemoth that gave off heat like a star going supernova, and once I’d got the hang of all that Shift-F7 crap it did come in pretty handy.
I suggested "Rainbow Soup."
Two years later, after I had started reading in English and, as a result, gotten better at it, I thought I would try again. It was one of the best thoughts I have had.

Good Morning Everyone,
Greg Leitich Smith's previous middle grade novels were pretty firmly located in contemporary school settings, but in his author's note to his new book, Chronal Engine, he says he's always loved survival stories and dinosaurs. That love shows, and so does a sympathy for his young teen characters. They find themselves in a setting where Jurassic Park meets, oh, maybe Jules Verne, with echoes of Conan Doyle's Lost World and possibly a touch of Robinson Crusoe, all of it pulled together with an adventure story sensibility that is squarely and effectively aimed at the middle grade reader. I had great fun talking to Greg about Chronal Engine. Here's Part 1 of a two-part conversation.

Now, are there any habits you think you are better off without, or are there some habits that need to be added or refined?A couple of years ago when we were doing a review of our nutrition, I worked out that by cutting back on sugar in my coffee, I would reduce my sugar intake by 5 kilos per year at least, based on 2 spoons per cup, once a day. I cut back over about a month. What about saving and investment habits, or exercise? How about relationship and social habits, or those that relate to your life passion? If something really is important to you, then you need to make time for it, even if only a little. Right? Each day you have 24 hrs to use so this is about becoming more mindful of the choices you are making each day in every area of your life. Let’s face it, when the end comes, you won’t be wishing you had spent more time watching TV will you? On the other hand you might wish you had read War and Peace, or that you had devoted more time to playing with your kids, mastering pastel drawing, or building an investment portfolio for your family’s long-term financial security.
“The Somali government will not take lightly the danger from their official union and will put all its forces, as well as the general public, on the highest alert.”
Ken Isaacs, vice president of Programs for Samaritan’s Purse, then shared how he called Franklin Graham right after the earthquake. They each felt God was burdening their hearts and agreed the Lord was calling them to Japan.
This success enabled Cline to buy her dream home in Nashville’s Goodlettsville community, personally decorated in her style featuring gold dust sprinkled in the bathroom tiles and a music room. Loretta Lynn stated in a 1986 documentary interview, “She called me into the front yard and said, ‘Isn’t this pretty? Now I’ll never be happy until I have my Mama one just like it.’” Cline called her home “the house that Vegas built” since she was able to pay it off with the money she earned during her time there. (Later, after Cline’s death in 1963, Cline’s home was sold by her husband to singer Wilma Burgess who told Patsy Cline author Ellis Nassour that “strange occurrences” happened during her years there.)
JJ: Here’s a perfect example of how it happens in dialogue, because Joel Lovell and I have been going back and forth, the last couple of weeks; “what’s gonna be the next thing?” I’m supposed to go to Rio to write about the slums that are in the hills around that city. There’s a Cuba story…But then there’s also this R.E.M. thing, which would be totally different. So, there you have the two channels in the book, one “pop” and one not.
No response.
V6 is also fascinating: (From the ESV Study Bible) “From Antioch in Pisidia, Paul and Timothy travel far northward, and then westward. Natural human wisdom would have led them to think they should preach the gospel in all the cities that they passed through, but instead the Holy Spirit directed them on a 400-mile journey by foot to Troas. They must have had a strong sense of the Spirit’s direct guidance and concluded that he would guide others to preach the gospel in the northern regions of Asia.”
I wrapped up my second D&D 4e session in Goodman Games Mists of Madness adventure module last week. It's a full module by Harley Stroh that only costs $2 (disclaimer- I bought the pdf during a recent sale at rpgnow for even less) and is for 1st level parties which is just what I needed. It is advertised as being 32 pages long, but after subtracting the OGL and advertisements is only around 25 pages in length. The adventure follows a well worn plot as the party must defeat a band of evil cultists before they can summon a lich. WARNING- there be spoilers ahead.
In addition, a recent study done by Richard E. Nisbett, author of Intelligence and How to Get It, states that
In order for glassware to be considered crystal it must contain lead oxide to give it an actual crystalline structure. This addition enhances the piece's brilliance and strength and also enables artisans to better work the molten material. The addition of lead also augments the cost of the item and the amount of time it takes to be manufactured.
These sisters act as one “face” of the Catholic Church (and Jesus Christ) to the American public. They have a sacred duty to uphold the teachings of the Catholic Church, yet many of them have been failing miserably in that regard, for many, many years.

00000001) There is not a lick of carpeting on the level of our house that contains the laundry room. Cleaning up a flood on a hard tile floor is one thing, but quite another (overturned) kettle of fish when carpet is involved (and by “involved”, I mean mold and its accompanying odor).
Guess she doesn't recognize me when I am in a baseball hat and running. That just shows you how much "working out" she has seen me doing over the past almost 7 years I have lived here. :)
I thought to buy this shirt for JR.
On Sunday as we all sat at our table binge drinking Lees Bitter, a couple of young girls came in. I say young, but I don't mean of illegal drinking age. After a little confusion which saw them being diverted from the Gents, they nipped into the Ladies, did whatever was needed and then came out and had a quick confab. It was clearly along the lines of "Should we buy a drink?" There was obviously no consensus reached (or maybe it was a compromise) as they approached the bar and bought one soft drink, which was quickly consumed. Now our pub is in the middle of nowhere and is quite relaxed about walkers coming in purely to use the facilities without being encumbered by any embarrassment about peeing and pissing off, but I wonder where that line should be drawn.
I had a great time with my friends, sitting around talking waiting for the signing to start and Ms. Mead was so friendly and accommodating. She read from the new book, did a Q and A and signed up to three books for around 350 people and she did it all with a smile.

“Very funny.” Even as Melanie muttered the words, she wondered if the sheriff had spoken facetiously or if, despite his seeming candor, he still considered her a suspect.
The war was lost not when the idiotic Bremer, who really represents the best America has to offer in career diplomats (you get to be a diplomat by graft, corruption and ass kissing) disbanded the Iraqi Army and turned the country's population into 70% unemployment zone; no, the war was lost when, after "liberation", American soldiers did NOT demolish Abu Ghraib, the prison where Saddam's thugs tortured men, women and children, but instead started to use said building complex, for the same reasons - to imprison and torture Iraqi men, women and children.
My elementary school teachers. The smell of their classrooms. Playing with my dolls. Playing with my cousins and neighbors. Talking to my mom. Basically every interaction ever with my Mom. And my dad. Oh my gosh, how much I longed to just curl up into a ball of little girl and sit on my dad's lap.
Yeh. Personally, I fucking hate the Beatles, so I dunno why dude chose to use the subtitle "Beatles drum take" for the opener, "Bullet Proof Nothing." The song stands on its own. Super-duper-simple, bare-bones snare drum and echoing guitar notes set this tune apart: "waitin' for the morning ship that never came...."

My one minor quarrel is with how the world has developed. Republic City has automobiles, radio, and instant film. It’s not that these couldn’t have developed in the time since the war (the Fire Nation already had antecedents to most of these technologies in the original series, they were just limited to military use), it’s that they developed along overly familiar (and Western) lines. I understand that the show is in part a metaphor for the rise of Communism in the Jazz Age. But in a world where people can shoot fire and make rocks fly around with their minds, I don’t know if they would have developed internal combustion engines, and then put them in cars which look pretty similar to our own.
I am writing about the slave trade from Africa to Cuba because of its influence on the music there. According to Sublette, Havana had a bigger music scene from “the early days of Spanish Colonization of the New world” than “the rest of the Antilles put together.” However, Sublette doesn’t delve into this point right afterwards but rather goes into the similarities and differences in African American and Afro-Cuban music (probably because of the slave trades influence on both America and Cuba), citing, “call and response, importance of rhythm, and spirit possession.”
Any ordinary man with a little intelligence and willpower, can breed chickens or pigs and make a profit. This is not the type of man I am referring to here. Those individuals who practice meagre subsistence farming, and who only produce enough to feed their families or small groups in their community, do not fall into the category I am going to discuss in this post.

My husband took some amazing photographs which were published in the local paper along with the story. In order to walk down the street, it was necessary to climb through the white van, as the road was completely blocked. We spent a long weary night working with the county surveyor, the electricity board and emergency builders to ensure that the house was safe to go back into and secure. We were a little astonished to be asked to give an assurance to the listed buildings person that we would not convert the hall into a garage now that we had seen that a car would fit into it.

Finally, an investigation of this monstrous crime against nature and humanity must be carried out by committees of workers in the oil industry, working with scientists and engineers accountable to the working class. We call on the International Trade Union Conference, the AFL-CIO, and the United Steelworkers (now home to the former Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers Union) to form an independent, international workers' commission of inquiry into this totally preventable disaster. We would want them to interview everyone who ever worked on this project, and every living victim of the explosion and its results, and to gather information not only on the immediate environmental and economic effects of the disaster, but also on the long term health effects to cleanup workers and Gulf residents, and other indirect consequences.

With a wide open space,
I followed the provided recipe using local napa cabbage for the greens, substituting soba noodles for the egg noodles and adding cilantro for visual flair (and flavor) at the end. The broth was very delicate, too much so for my taste. I ended up adding lime juice, s'rircha and additional soy sauce and sesame oil to amp up the flavor yet still felt like something was missing. Perhaps the soba noodles were too much for the broth? Either way I don't plan to revisit the recipe.
From this, I decided that I will always take contentment over excitement. It gets the stamp for a “Good Day.”

And again, it didn’t stop once the truck rolled out of the driveway. In August 2011, with the help of Jennifer Blake, another sweet Bama Belle living in LA, we were able to hold a benefit and raise some money. With these funds, trees were purchased from Habitat for Humanity and planted where so many had been ripped from the soil. This made us, and Mother Nature happy

Most of the time, when I think about it, I get so excited, and antsy, wondering how he will be when he's in high school. What sports he will be playing. What kind of car he will want for his 16th birthday.
People today wrongly pray for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit as they say the disciples did in the upper room. But I tell you the disciples were not praying for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. They knew what was expected of them and I am sure they were seeking wisdom as to how to go about replacing Judas and preparing themselves for the great ministry that had been given to them.
Little W tells us in a shaky voice that he had indeed been picked up and taken in for military service. After a couple of days, they must have sussed he wasn't going to be much help and brought him home. L and P tease him for crying and he denies it. I get angry and say anyone would bawl under the circumstances and he throws me a grateful glance. I can see that L and P are just trying to cover up their own fear by laughing at someone they perceive as weaker.
Most everyone I knew had this three LP album "All Things Must Pass" by George Harrison. This was the first triple album released by a solo artist and in regards to the album's size, Harrison stated "I didn't have many tunes on Beatles records, so doing an album like "All Things Must Pass" was like going to the bathroom and letting it all out."
Lucretia Coffin Mott in 1842 (1793–1880) was an American Quaker, abolitionist, social reformer, and proponent of women’s rights. She is said to be one of the first American feminists in the early 19th century, & she surely was an early advocate for women’s political power & influence in America, where women could not vote until 1920.
Moving the ice shanty over the snow was easy. Clearing a space on the ice, where the water was deep enough, I cut a large hole in the ice. Moving the ice shanty, aligning the hole in the floor with the hole in the ice was simple enough. I banked the ice house with snow to keep out the cold wind.

In the photo, you see slices of ham rolled around dill pickles. I converted this recipe a bit from one my friend Kalyn uses for Super Bowl. In Kalyn's recipe (actually her sister's) the ham slices are slathered with cream cheese before rolling. I would skip the cheese! It would be reduced-fat! Then I could fry the rolls for burny flavor and the cheese wouldn't all melt out.

1 PM Saturday. Last night I was to perform for a room full of grumpy old Jews in Exeter, south Devon. I expected to face sour, smug faces filled with resentment and bitterness of a people who weren’t living where they thought they belonged – in New York or at the very least, north London – and with no respect for me for having been crazy to leave New York and not successful enough for them to have heard of me.

The Rebel Angel series reveals a plot which is epic and sprawling, and Bloodstone is a book you need to read in one sitting or you will get lost if you let too much time pass between readings. Philip creates a fine balance between Sithe and human worlds – merging and separating them as skilfully as a painter wielding a brush, telling intensely personal stories against the backdrop of greed, loyalty, power and love. As you are captivated by the words and the story, you will find yourself on the edge of your seat, wondering who to trust, who to believe in, as the author weaves a rich tapestry filled with characters that are both beguiling and enchanting. Don’t blame me if your brain becomes addled, your gut mangled and your heart wrenched whilst reading Bloodstone – it is a book of pure bewitchment, and one which never lets the reader off lightly.
Well, look, I haven’t seen Claire Danes in a lot of stuff – just Romeo + Juliet and Terminator 3 (and I had to check her filmography for both of them) – but I don’t remember her being too bad in either film. Here, though, she gives a strangely over-animated performance that’s deeply distracting. There’s a moment where she has to deliver a lengthy monologue declaring her undying love to a small furry animal, and it’s one of the oddest pieces of screen acting I can recall – eyes rolling, eyebrows waggling, emphasising the dialogue a bit too much. It’s a bit like watching Al Pacino at his least restrained, or the Haitian puppet theatre.
Love and hugs to you all,

This is why the 3by3 writing method inserts constant contained conflict in every character and each scene. With conflicted characters and scenes, the story often falls flat or gets stopped.
But Herschell's greatest power as both director and writer is that nothing in Blood Feast can be taken seriously for a minute. This is almost as if the Monty Python boys made a mad slasher flick. Not one character has a realistic reaction to the carnage surrounding them (the cops, when confronted with a dripping red room and the bloodied corpse within, rub the backs of their heads and recite platitudes), and the acting style rests squarely in the Mack Sennett School of Subtleties.

After receiving the Spirit, I passionately wanted to see my loved ones receive the same experience. It took three years before my zeal reaped a harvest. I began college at Texas Tech, and for the two years I was there, I witnessed to—really more like badgered—my mother from afar about her need for the baptism of Holy Ghost. She and my father were Christians and very involved in their Baptist church in Austin, but I kept insisting that, despite their experience with Christ, God still had more for them. After I transferred to the University of Texas and moved in with them, I indefatigably reminded them of this. I must have been perfectly annoying.

“This book convincingly documents that what people want from our economic system is more time, more equality, more well-being, and better health. People want an economy that is not an obstacle to social relations, one that does not produce more insecurity, one that allows life in a better and sustainable natural environment. In short, people want an economy made for people.”—Stefan Bartolini, Università degli Studi di Siena, author of Manifesto for Happiness

Natalie saw the first spell in the supermarket car park. It was floating in a puddle near the recycling bins, glimmering bronze and green in the October drizzle. At first she thought it was a leaf, but as she drew closer it began to look more like a crumpled sweet wrapper – a very interesting sweet wrapper. Pick me up, it seemed to say. Surely I’m worth a closer look?

In that way, I am an example of being good enough for God. Be connected to Christ. Hear his Word and believe it. Think on your Baptism with faith in the new life and forgiveness God has given you in that water. Receive the Lord’s Supper believing that all the blessings of Christ’s life, death, and resurrection are given to you in his body and blood with that bread and wine. Being good enough for God is not about what you do or anything you could offer. Being good enough for God is all about what God has done for you in Christ.

Each budget we can never be fair, but in the budget, I want to look at how you manage the money, wisely. Not giving out tactically. With such budget, all ministries will be sure to out perform, so we better be prepared for a high performance bonus. No one can fail, first in a budget for the future, or a budget with no Ooomp, no push in it. To me the ministry of finance is too lax in using our money.

I have no response to claims of ugliness and boneheaded design decisions. They’re in there, for sure. I WILL say that I have already encountered some wonderful and truly creative boss fights I’ve had in quite a while (and I have heard it gets even better by the end of the game) as well as some weird as hell ideas. No, seriously, the game turned into a seriously meta choose-your-own-adventure book for more than an hour there last night, and this isn’t counting the already showcased “Diablo time” and “Twinstick shooter time” going on. These developers have odd brains.
Further, although the Frenchman’s lawyer offered up £1million in bail, gave a permanent address where he could live with his sister – and accept 24/7 monitoring – the Judge turned it down. He could’ve worked from her apartment, now he can’t. Sticking him in prison doesn’t make sense (if he’s monitored, he’s monitored) unless you’re trying to make somebody look dangerous. (When he arrived at the bail hearing, the accused was handcuffed and frog-marched in).
A week later I was hitchhiking, and the lawyer who was in the courtroom at my hearing picked me up and we laughed all the way through town. It was just a ridiculous coincidence.
OK, on to my point: I was pondering the verse in which Christ says, “anyone who wishes to follow me must deny him or herself, and take up his or her cross, and follow me.” And I realized how that verse has been misused to make people believe that they are meant to deny their identity, their very nature or self! That if you are going to be a Christian, you have to get over your SELF, who you really are, because otherwise God can’t accept you.
Another common mistake of a follower is not keeping her own balance, thus dragging the leader out of his balance. A good follower is neither heavy nor too light, neither stiff nor too soft. It's strenuous to dance with a heavy woman, but if she is too light he can’t feel her. It's not pleasant to dance with a rigid woman, but if she is like spaghetti he can’t enjoy her either. A good follower is relaxed, comfortable to hold in the arms, surrendered with slight resistance, self-balanced, and remaining in control of herself. Some women tend to be tense in the embrace, and they release their tension through head or hands against the leader, which causes heaviness on him. Everyone has his/her own way to release tension. It is preferable to release tension through feet to the ground.
“Montreal-based art initiative EN MASSE is best described as an ongoing exercise in irreverent, improvised collaborative drawing — a boundary-blurring cocktail of high and lowbrow culture, pop imagery fragmented like shattered glass in a spontaneous, multi-genre, black-on-white collision.”
We have to consider how we shall handle this, how we shall defend ourselves against such unimaginable odds. We need to realise the fact that we are unarmed compared to them, that our numbers are negligible compared to theirs, that we are spread out and far apart, that we are untrained and unskilled with nowhere to run and that we have run out of time. We have become so accustomed to the good life of luxury and abundance that we have forgotten how to survive and depend upon ourselves and our immediate surroundings to survive and co-exist with nature and how to identify and effectively utilise what nature has to offer. And PLEASE forget about outside help. No foreign country in the world would come help us, as they would much rather help the ANC as they have been doing for the past one hundred years.

I'm going to be spending a Friday and Saturday with some friends at a women's conference in Long Beach. Time Out For Women. The ladies I'm going with all went last year (to Fresno!) and loved it so much they decided to go every year, and this year I got an invite. As with all things that disrupt my safe little routine, I was very excited to be invited and to attend, but now that it's tomorrow, I'm having my usual neurotic doubts and misgivings. What if my ankle acts up, what if I'm achey all weekend? What if I just want to come home? What will they think when they find out how much I really hobble around at the end of the day? What if I'm no fun? You see how my mind runs.

The downfall of our ego is the fact that as much as it loves to sabotage with negative thoughts of how “unworthy/ other label” you are, it ALSO LOVES to praise itself for how “AWESOME/ Special/ insert other label” you are. Then it will make comparisons, to other events, people… etc etc. If you had a friend that was as undecided as your ego is about its opinion of you, you would probably deem that friend as MAD and run as far away as you could:))

In contrast, two days after radio show host Rush Limbaugh called community activist Sandra Fluke a slut, President Obama took time out of his busy day to make a personal phone call to her to "offer his support to her, he wanted to express his disappointment that she has been the subject of inappropriate personal attacks and to thank her for exercising her rights as a citizen to speak out on an issue of public policy."
Her company issues a seal of approval, A Blue Butterfly, to those companies whose practices meet very demanding standards of sustainability. It begins by having these companies fill out self-assessment forms and then by using an elaborate algorithm that culls through social media, the Internet, and public records for data about the company, to generate a profile. If all the standards are met they get the seal of approval. So now you can feel good about the products you buy for your home and family, knowing that the designer or manufacturer is behaving ethically and that you are also playing a role by supporting only these well-behaved companies. The website profiles big designer names as well as small business owners.
Prue Leith had many cookery books published in the earlier part of her life. In the comparatively new genre of novel-writing she is very competent and the book held my interest. Perhaps she might have considered giving the sisters in questions more distinctive names – Carrie and Poppy can easily be mixed up. Carrie is not entirely likeable for most of the book, but (as in the advice given in most writing courses)she changes for the better as the book progresses.
Along with these new definitions of bodily maladies came also new definitions for standards of health and wellness, and a new more powerful medical regime whose ability to shape and define the character of disease also allowed it the capacity to shape and regulate the very way society was to come to define bodily characteristics as either normal and abnormal ( Cregan, 2006: 50). Through this capacity medicine became a harbinger of social and moral control via its capacity to interpret abnormality and illness (Cregan, 2006: 46).
In 1985, Bangalore got its first ‘pub’, called The Ramada Pub, which sold draught beer and it was my ‘duty’ to try it out (every night!) as I considered myself a self-proclaimed ‘beer guru’.

Waltz is one of my favorite dances, and Petra looked beautiful in this dance. The dress was gorgeous, her expression was perfect, and the choreography suited her wonderfully. Her improvement is huge, her posture is far better than that first Foxtrot, and she is finally learning how to comport herself with grace. She danced beautifully, except in frame.
Jan. 7 (Bloomberg) -- South Africa’s national schools pass rate dropped for a sixth consecutive year, condemning millions to a life of unemployment and fueling crime, even as the government ramped up spending on education.

And when a beautiful baby girl was born this past summer with KT's eyes and Kiwi's face, it seemed pretty darn perfect up there in the mountains. Until the ground slid and the earth started moving in ways they never expected. You know when you have a baby and you worry about every thing that COULD go wrong and everyone tells you it never happens? Well, the cold, hard truth is...it does happen to some babies. Some mamas have their fears confirmed. And while the situation may be something you can manage? It's still scary as hell and it never feels fair.
They're green actually. Did you know that all 6 of my kids have different colored eyes? Weird, huh?

Please don't try to tackle all of these skills at once. Build upon what your child already knows and gradually incorporate new information as you go along. These are all skills that can be taught in a fun and stress-free environment! Your child does not have to sit at a desk for 30 minutes a day in order to be successful. (You'll both end up going crazy if you try to do it that way!) Spend a few minutes here and there throughout each day. Capitalize on 'teaching moments' - moments when you can slip in new information, reinforce what you have already been working on, or ask your child to demonstrate what he/she has learned.
The Sound were an English post-punk band, formed in 1979 disbanding in 1988. The band was fronted by Adrian Borland and evolved from his previous band, The Outsiders.

Today is national baby day which means I’m going to provide you guys with some amazing facts about babies! Have you ever wondered the stats on how many babies are born? Well, down below are some awesome facts how frequent they’re born!
I was really torn about DNF-ing this book because it has SO much potential and I really wanted to love it. I felt invested in the idea of it and I had a real hard time accepting that the reality didn't exactly mesh up with my expectations.
"It is said that the name "omena" was an Ojibwe expression that meant "is that so?" or "is that really true." Local tradition says that Rev. Daugherty responded to most statements made by his flock with "omena." Another meaning of Omena is "apple" from the Finnish word, although it is not known if many Finns arrived in the area."
We came home, I gave up on the cleaning idea as I was tired from the walking. So, I pulled out my spinning wheel. I finished most of the ounce I had started back in September. When I went to get the box with the rest of the fiber, it was gone. I searched the few spots it could possibly be. I'll search a little deeper tomorrow, but I'm not holding out any hope.
This week I got to splurge a little bit with work and received a makeover from the NARS international makeup team with my boss! It was definitely fun to do something out of the ordinary and extremely girly. My make-up artist was from Texas, was super friendly and got very excited when I told him he could go wild and do anything he wanted. He almost jumped for joy that I didn’t ask for the “everyday-look” and immediately started dancing while shouting “smokey eye smokey eye smokey eye!” So, I really had no choice. I think my favorite part, besides having someone oo and ah and how “beautiful” you look with all your new make-up on, (Thats part of their job description to say that but I don’t care) was the names of the products. They vary from raunchy, to feminine, to demonic, which happened to be what he used on me. Not so sure how I feel about that, but it was very entertaining.

Last week I took my pantry makeover one step further and designed some fun and vintage-inspired labels that make me smile every time I look at them! I believe that organizing should be equal parts pretty and practical, and I think this fits the bill! I loved the white baskets for loose kitchen items so much, that I even bought some for the fridge and am head over heels in love with them. Can't beat their $2 price tag either!

A few summer's ago we made a deal: eat all summer long from only the food co-op & the farmer's markets minus a Costco list of dog food, coffee, flour, sugar, and a few other items we couldn't afford to buy locally. We did okay but it was far from perfect. Part of it was us, part of it was a financial issue (suppose that is us too), & part was a timing issue with getting enough food from the markets and having it last (the cheaper & more variety at the co-op 1x a month: the more pricey & hit-or-miss farmer's markets 1-2x a week).
The point is this:

Using my empathy, I focused on trying to pick up on the emotions of any lucid person around, hoping I would hone in on Jessica’s emotions. Normally, the waking feelings of others hit me like a gale force wind, without my even trying. In fact, it had always felt like a bit of a curse that I was a walking sponge for other people’s pain.
In the pamphlet, the DA is portrayed as a racist party, claiming that the DA wants to bring back the days of 'permits', in order to fight the 'Swart Gevaar'. The pamphlet ends with the words 'Warning: Do not show this pamphlet to your maids and garden boys ... we need their votes'.

- Do inhabitants experience local identities? Which stories can be told related to the landscape?
Our two protagonists are Henry and Anne. Because of Henry’s upbringing in the sea and upbringing at the hands of Allard, a scholar under the sway of Robert Claybrook, the closest thing thing this novel has to a villain, we learn a lot of the worldbuilding organically, but Henry is a fascinating force of nature until himself. He’s cruel, stubborn, and, remarkably, just; his disgust with the lies of politicking and his commitment to not lying becomes an important plot point towards the end of the novel. I can see how Henry might turn off some readers, but he’s not an evil character; he’s a product of the sea, where life is move or die. He’s stunningly complex, which also goes for Anne. Unable to play the games of court well, Anne cultivates a reputation as a devout simpleton—while her faith is unshakable, she’s also clever. And scared. And wants the best for her sister, even when circumstances force her to threaten war against her. Whitfield doesn’t deserve complexity for her two leads; the rest of the cast has organic and sometimes conflicting motivations, like Henry’s best friend, the landsman John. These characters, deepsmen and landsmen alike, feel like real people; I became so invested in these characters that I worried about them when I wasn’t reading the novel. It’s truly impressive.
The message was from A. I was groggy and re read the messages again. I was shocked to receive a message from him after all this time. And the way he spoke … why, it's as if nothing happened.
The large flowers were made with grungepaper and Wendy Vecchi stamps and glued to bamboo skewers which I'd inked with DI Forest Moss. The flower in front was made using tattered florals and a spiral rose. Although they can't really be seen there are also other two flowers on the base made from tissue and dictionary papers which had been cut with spellbinders, coloured with the inks and scrunched up to look like carnations.

Remember this important point: while retirement planning software can certainly give you great budgeting advice to keep you on track in your retirement planning, only you can take action on that advice. Unfortunately, most people never start planning for retirement or watching their finances carefully until it’s too late; when they hit retirement, they realize they have no money to do anything they wanted.

For those to whom these feelings overwhelm, experience steps in and they/we create, consciously and unconsciously, conditions in their/our life that send them/us spiraling into the dark night of the soul and the supreme realization at that point is that change is an experience. That, perhaps, there is more to life than what we have previously known, that perhaps drugs aren’t the way out at all. Perhaps there is a bliss beyond the sexual orgasm, a physical contentment beyond that provided by the comfort foods that we consume daily. That experience is not bounded by what we’ve experienced before. That there are new experiences out there, new forms of perception, new forms of sustenance, new forms of living, of loving, of experiencing life in its variagated aspects.

After I left the hospital, I crawled into my bed feeling drained and defeated, and I called my daddy. I told him that I felt like I was stuck in a suspense movie. You watch these movies, and you watch the main character slowly approach a door; fear and anticipation builds of what is on the other side. Finally the door is opened and nothing is there. The main character breathes a sigh of relief and continues her slow creep down the hall to find the bad guy. I have opened several doors, but each time the door opens and nothing is there, relief is an initial feeling and then the anticipation and fear sets in again, because the bad guy is still out there. I just want to find the bad guy…

This is what I've observed my timeline, there was the story of the girl hopping out of a car to slash another girl on Franklin near Lincoln Pl. There was the shooter who fired from a roof top on Franklin near Union in the middle of the day as high schools let out a few weeks ago there were several local robberies I heard about through word of mouth more recently, and then I was mugged and just a few days ago a man shot five times on Franklin and Lincoln.

Ms. Pelosi also stated, “Our Founders had an idea. It was called democracy.

Everyone in high positions in the government takes a solemn oath to uphold and obey the Constitution, but nearly all of them totally ignore the Constitution. The president issues executive orders that are totally unconstitutional, and Congress passes laws that the Constitution specifically forbids. Our God-given Constitution is the reason the United States has become the greatest country in the world, but it is being thoroughly undermined today by the Jesuits in government as they work to convert the United States into a ruthless police state.

Ms. Burden also has an intimate familiarity and appreciation for the topic of superblocking. In early 2006 Ms. Burden weighed in against superblocking at the redesigned World Trade Center site: “We need our streets, we need connectivity, we need an open Cortlandt St. for light and air and to create normal blocks,” and “It is important to open a street that has been closed for decades.” (See: Not ready to close the debate on opening Cortlandt St, By Ronda Kaysen, February 17 - 23, 2006 in the Downtown Express, extracting from a Feb. 6 World Trade Center Committee meeting.)

In verse 21, Christ again says, ‘Peace be with you’ — the same benediction that Gideon received in his own commission from God (Judges 6:22-23). Our Lord then tells them they must now go and preach The Word. They have experienced His life, watched Him die and now they have seen Him risen. They must now tell the world, take His peace to the people in His name and under His authority. A commission from Jesus Christ has the same authority as one from God the Father. And the disciples are to begin immediately. Christ breathes upon them (verse 22), and they are filled with the Holy Spirit. By doing this, Christ is conferring upon them full ability and grace to carry out His work. They would have realised that no one before had ever been able to bestow the gift of the Holy Spirit, even Moses. But, because the Holy Spirit is Christ’s own gift, He is able to give it to the disciples directly. Today’s believers in Christ are also to receive and use His gift of the Holy Spirit. This is why Confirmation is so important.

Recently, there has been quite a lot of attention in the media and the blogosphere about the whole issue of open-access journals. The issue is this: academics in taxpayer-funded universities produce research in the form of articles that they publish in journals run by for-profit corporations. The said corporations then sell the research, which they got for free, for a princely sum. Journal subscriptions are expensive, which means that most taxpayers are unable to read the research they have paid for unless they are members of a university community. The Economist magazine, which is hardly known for its left-wing views or hostility to the profit motive, recently denounced the whole academic publishing industry, noting that profit margins in it extremely high. Of course, they are high: most of the actual work (writing articles, editing journals, doing the peer-reviewing) is done by volunteers.
Growing up, my parents never ate lobster, although it was a plentiful catch and could be had for pennies a pound. Their mothers would have been mortified if they’d been reduced to serving lobster to their families. It was not something you ate unless you were starving; then, if your neighbours wouldn’t feed you and you had to eat lobster, you buried the shells in the night so that those heartless neighbours would not know what you’d done.

I observed his lonely walk the following morning and the morning after that. The next day I left the blinds down. There was plenty of light. I wondered about getting curtains, something fine and filmy that wouldn’t obscure the view, but would stop people from seeing in.

Thanks to Amazon’s US-centric approach, I’m even more excited about the Kobo Vox. I’ve yet to experience it in person, but from the specs it looks like a cool –and affordable- little tablet. It will have a browser and Android apps, and you can view the content you buy on other devices. I’ve experienced this on my Kobo Wifi with books I’ve bought. I haven’t been able to read magazine or newspaper subscriptions on my BlackBerry though.

After all those year, and after they promised me by a previous problem, that they will send the papers and instructions for return in the packet, still no return papers are available in the post-packet. No instructions for the customer how to return the products when he is dissatisfied with them. In case you have a printer you can download them from the website, if you were able to find the appropriate, difficult to find, document. (In the mean time the clock is running and you are loosing lots of time to be in time to return the goods.)
I drank my Sprite Zero and ate my peanuts which were pretty decent. It wasn’t long after that I began to see the plane descending enough where I could make out buildings, etc on the ground below. I was thinking to myself “about time” when a few minutes later, I noticed that the plane was begin to ascend again into the sky. I looked around and right at that moment the flight attendant came on the intercom and stated that the fasten seat belt light is on that everyone should remain in their seats and not form a line at the bathroom. Then came the real…the pilot came over the intercom and started by saying, “This is your pilot.” He proceeded to state that air traffic controllers were not allowing the plane we were on or any other planes land at Lambert International due to inclement weather conditions. He was advised to fly out about 80 miles and so he advised that they were just circling around out there at the moment as a result. I was like seriously? What if the plane runs out of fuel?! He said that there were other planes out there as well and I was like you mean to tell me that there are other planes out here circling as well at night in the sky waiting to land… o_O
If there’s one thing I learned from practicing estate planning in Southwest Florida, it’s the importance of client communication. It is (or should be) well known among attorneys that the perennial number one complaint clients have about them is lack of communication. Polls and complaints to state bar and legal watchdog organizations routinely show that nothing bothers clients more not being kept informed of the progress of their case and not having their phone calls or e-mails returned. Laypersons or inexperienced attorneys are sometimes surprised to learn that malpractice and the mishandling of client funds take a back seat to mere silence in the hierarchy of grievances. But it makes sense. For lawyers, each case is one of dozens to be juggled and prioritized simultaneously, but for ordinary folks, legal actions are intense little bundles of hope, fear, or anger. Trusting your case to a lawyer and then waiting in the dark to hear what it happening is like dropping a sick child off at the hospital and then not being told whether or not she’s getting better or worse.

Though it is relatively new to the United States, Bonal has been around since 1885. Quinquinas like Bonal are very similar to vermouth in that they are aromatized, fortified wines, usually based on white wine or mistelle--non-fermented or partially fermented grape juice with alcohol added. What makes them different is what is then added. A variety of herbs are used in both to create the unique flavor, but generally quinquinas have a significant amount of cinchona bark. Vermouths don't usually include this ingredient, and if they do, in much smaller quantities. Vermouths, on the other hand, were known for their inclusion of wormwood--"wermut" is the German word for wormwood. This distinction has become less important over the years, though some vermouths do still utilize scant amounts of wormwood in their recipes.
What if you only had 37 days left to live on this Earth...what would you do...where would you go...who would you see? I first became aware of Patti's work on her blog 37 Days. She urges everyone to fully experience life in the present moment. Rent the RED convertible! Burn those Jeans! Unpack your Boxes! Love unlovable People! Her essays were compiled to become a book which I absolutely adore and use regularly called "Life is a Verb: 37 Days to Wake Up, Be Mindful, and Live Intentionally"

The other thing they updated was the black and white tool. Now you can add color filters to affect the contrast. I don’t know why this wasn’t there to begin with. I can feel comfortable deleting simply b&w now because I only kept that around in case I wanted to use a color filter.
When I think of summer fruits as as child, the first thing that comes to mind are big, red, sweet and firm cherries. My brother and I had a ritual of searching for the ones with the stems joined together and saving them since they were the "good luck" ones.

We all understand the need to sometimes bump off a main character. What would be the point of The Great Gatsby, Romeo and Juliet and Don Quixote if their protagonists had lived to ripe old ages? Don Quixote would have ended in the madhouse, Gatsby in jail and Montagues and Capulets would go on feuding in the streets of Verona, until Doomsday. Death in novels always has an objective, to teach the reader (as well as other characters in the book) a moral lesson. Whether is Anna Karenina jumping in front of a train, or Sydney Carton climbing to the guillotine, there is a moral behind their death: It is a far better thing to die than to go on sinning or leading a dull meaningless life.
That being said I will say that designer Jacob Covey has done a sterling job in constructing a Barksian feel to all the elements he has assembled and the letter forms look really lovely, neatly complimented by the clean and unfussy color scheme. It's also worth pointing out that Fantagraphics will be including all of Bark's covers, which again gives this collection the edge over it's Gladstone predecessor in terms of completeness.
But still all in all, a great day!
For example, I target a lot of auto repair shops. I’ve found that Monday mornings are the worst since most people are dropping their cars off for service as well as most afternoons (after 3pm) since the mechanics are scrambling to finish up cars before people pick them up. During the rest of the week, I’ve found that mid morning (10-11:30am) and after lunch (1-3pm) are the best times to reach auto repair owners.
I am self-published. I’m a bit of a control freak and I like having the total creative control over my work. No one is going to be as passionate about my books as I am. No one is going to care as deeply about how they are presented or marketed. No publisher is going to believe in them as much as I do. If my books are good, they’ll find an audience. If they’re not, they won’t. I’m not against traditional publishing. For me, it

Felix the questions he was being asked.
Have you ever written something that scared you?
Are we any different? When our circumstances squeeze us, so often we wonder if God is really “for us”, and we put him to the test in our prayers with a mentality that says, “If God is good, then surely he will ____________ for me.” God has told us that he is unchanging (James 1:17) and he has told us that “in him is no darkness at all” (1 John 1:5), so we can trust that he will always do what he says he’s going to do for us. We, on the other hand, are the ones with hearts that are “deceitful above all things, and desperately sick” (Jeremiah 17:9). Consequently, we should be suspicious of ourselves, not God. I know I’ve said this before, but we need to be a people who are asking open-ended questions of our hearts: “Why did I say that? What did I want when I did that? What does that kind of thinking reveal about where my priorities are? Is what I am telling myself reflective of God’s truth, or is it a lie?” Certainly we can go nuts with this and become morbidly introspective, but the point is not to know your heart with scary-specific precision. Rather, it is to expose your heart for what it is and then redirect it with God’s truth, pleading with him to help you break free from our world’s popular “just follow your heart” philosophy. I believe it is one of the enemy’s great ploys to keep us suspicious of the One on whom suspicion is wasted so that our spiritual eyes don’t see all the incriminating evidence that lies within. Church, let us pray for God to help us trust him and distrust ourselves.

When I started The Zurian Child, I had to do a lot of online research to figure out the details of the planet I wanted my aliens to be from. By searching through the NASA sight, I learned about Planet Quest and set out to find a planet that fit the description I had in mind. When I checked “planets within multiple planet systems” and “Terrestrial”, links to nine planets appeared in my search results. When I do the same thing today, seventeen planets pop up, most of them discovered since the Kepler mission began.
As a final note, I watched this on a free movie channel on the Roku. This channel, Drive-In Classics, cuts into the film at regular intervals with advertising. I don’t much mind the ads, except that many of them cut off halfway through and take a long time to queue up. It would bother me a lot less if someone would find good places to slip the ads in. Frequently, the ads show up in the middle of someone’s line or a tense sequence, which sort of kills the mood.

Owens was one of the most dominant athletes of his day. But in fairness to the competition, Ralph Metcalf didn’t run his best 100 in Berlin, starting very poorly – that bit of good fortune on Owens part. Lewis too was one of the most dominant athletes of his day. But again in fairness to the competition, WR holder Calvin Smith was injured just before the Trials and just missed making the 100 meter squad – and would run a windy 9.94 before the Games, as well as perform on the winning/WR setting 4x1 at the Games: similarly Mel Lattany who ran the 3nd fastest time in history to date at 9.96 in May was also injured before the Trials; and Ron Brown, who had previously beaten Carl Lewis in the 100 at the ’83 Jenner Classic (10.02w to 10.03w) would be injured prior to the Games and was not at his best in Los Angeles – all contributed to the good fortune on Lewis’ part.

Even crunchy foods annoy me, though I’ve taken that down a notch over the years because I know that’s kind of irrational. Crunchy foods simply aren’t quiet.

The next card I had started way back in summer when I got home from Gatlinburg. We met my SIL Beth and her family down there. They were staying for a while but we went down for a day and had fun shopping at the Super Scrapbook Store together. I bought some new JustRite stamp sets and knew which one I wanted to use to make a special card for Sandy. I stamped and punched out the center and it just set on my desk forever. This past week I made her card. It was hard to get a good picture but here it is:

They aren't that expensive any more and you will be glad to have them right where you need them.

I took this to the machine and did a blanket stitch all around. Remember to take it really slow because you only get one chance at this! Each stitch puts a whole in the fabric, this is why I like to use a really simple shape like a circle, I have also done stars and squares would work too. I haven't tried stitching through it by hand, basically because I think it would be a challenge to get the needle through. If you want to though, go for it :)

Schlussel was a fine malty beer although it had slightly too much carbonation for my taste. The two I preferred though, and was quite suprised about, were Fuchsen and Schumacher. Both had a wonderful hoppiness which I wasn't expecting in an Alt.

Neither did it almost break my neck whilst leaping at me after madly charging out of its goal.

But he was asked if the NotW paid “corrupt” police officers. Therefore he could say that the NotW did not pay “corrupt” officers, but instead paid honest ones. As the wise blogger and Twitterer @loveandgarbage pointed out, the Prevention of Corruption legislation makes payments like this illegal both by the donor and the recipient. However, if Mr Coulson believed these were legitimate payments, tied in perhaps with the “crime fighting” role of the NotW, then the fact that, in law, recipients of the payments were ipso facto “corrupt” would not be enough, in my view, to establish perjury. Ignorance of the law cannot make a statement false where the person believes it to be true.
It's educational, which for me is the main purpose of a zoo, and fun. Over the years it has developed into an outstanding attraction. And, for the last two years, entry from November to early February has been free.

So an economist who accepts the possibility of an oil peak may still believe that the marketplace will allow us to make a relatively smooth transition to a new energy economy as the price encourages the development of alternatives to oil and as demand is destroyed. The latter phrase is often glossed over. But demand destruction is at the core of misconceptions by economists about the likely course of events leading up to and following an oil peak.

He began with her, but presently it seemed to be Mrs. Bowen that he was thinking of; then he knew he was dropping off to sleep by the manner in which their two ideas mixed. The fatigues and excitements of the week had been great, but he would not give way; it was too disgraceful.

Upon closer inspection, or rather staring at it blankly, he realized the Sun was a glorified ball of flame. It didn’t have the solar and blinding aspect the standard sun did. It calmed him slightly to think of it as a giant torch light rather than a miniature sun. Any pictures he had seen of his sun portrayed it as volatile and chaotic. No matter how much it was scaled down, if this would have been the same thing, there would be no way for the land below to survive.

Wilensky only speaks of wealthy democracies, but it’s exceedingly clear that conflating economic and social policy has been a key aspect of developing nations under authoritarian governments. Mainland China under Deng Xiaoping and successors, Taiwan under Chiang Kai-shek, South Korea under Park Chung-hee, Indonesia under Suharto, all these nations centered their efforts around rigidly focused economic policies. Not only has the idea been that sustained economic development ensures the legitimacy of the dominant regime, but also that it provides the raw capital and infrastructure to raise the living standards of the people.

I watched the baking time carefully and in my oven it took 10 minutes to get to the "top springs back when touched" doneness.

White nationalism doesn’t address why all of these alien tribes have popped up in our midst. WNs like to blame these and other problems on the Jews, and while I acknowledge that they’ve had a disproportionate, malign influence, the fact of the matter is that the ideology that wrecked the West, liberalism, originates from whites. (Note: for the purposes of this essay only, I will regard Jews as a separate entity from whites.) The intellectual forbears of modern liberalism and its offshoot ideologies like multiculturalism and feminism were all gentiles – 17th and 18th century thinkers like John Locke, Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Adam Smith. The Jewish establishment in the modern West is merely a vector for a white-created disease of the mind.

I turned up for an interview with the managing director of this major electronics company, expecting to be told that I was stupid----he started of by saying that he couldn't offer me the accounting job--even though I had aced the mathematical testing, the aptitude testing said that my abilities should be used elsewhere---I stood up, shook his hand and thanked him but he stopped me---no Clyde, we wont give you this job but what we want to offer you is a cadetship in Electrical Engineering--we will pay you to go to University and you will work with our engineers here and interstate---you will be fast tracked and from what your testing reveals, you should have a 5 year degree in 3 years.

Let us guess that about half of the overhang is indeed within NAMA and therefore capable of sale on the basis proposed. That being so, the proposals would result in a reduction in NAMA debt of about €4.1b, that is, about 13.6% of the total amount currently owed by NAMA.

This exhibition at the National Maritime Museum – guest-curated by David Starkey – celebrates five hundred years of the London Thames and its relationship with our monarchs. The narrative sweep is partitioned neatly and chronologically. We see how Tudor and Stuart rulers mounted simply enormous royal processions, mainly for propagandistic purposes. Henry VIII did one for Anne Boleyn. Charles II introduced Catherine of Braganza to the London public with a huge river display for which Pepys himself could not get a berth on any boat for under eight shillings, leaving us to rely on John Evelyn’s account. The Queen’s procession on 3rd June will be the first in 350 years to rival these.

I had two clear choices – Bali or Yogyakarta. I thought it’s better to go to Bali with friends, since it’s a beach and I won’t enjoy myself just being alone walking barefoot on the sand, staring into nothing until I get a hold of myself and realize I am chest-deep in seawater, facing the open sea with tears streaming down my face. Or get locked out of my room with a busted key card. Anyway, I chose to go to Yogyakarta mainly because it’s easier to be a lone tourist just wandering around the cliche-ic temples and cultural sites.

More on what that ulterior motive was in a second, let's talk about Alex's first night in his new apartment. The sexually frustrated painter–oh, didn't I mention that he's a sexually frustrated painter? well, he is (on top of painting, not having sex, and going to school, he also works at a video store)–lies in his bed listening to the sound of Nicole moaning with pleasure as a result of whatever that heavy metal dude she brought up to her apartment was doing to her (the whole sequence is seen through Alex's eyes, so we don't exactly see what this guy is actually doing to make her moan like that). At any rate, the last thing we hear is the sound of Nicole's gentlemen caller screaming. Interesting.
For instance, one of my patients, in computer graphics, kept hammering his wife with a poor-me attitude about how he always got stuck with boring projects at work. Instead of trying to improve the situation, he just kvetched. She started dreading those conversations, and diplomatically mentioned it to him. This motivated my patient to address the issue with his supervisor, which got him more stimulating assignments. Similarly, whenever I slip into vampire mode, I try to examine and alter my behavior or else discuss the particulars with a friend or a therapist so I can change. Don’t hesitate to seek assistance when you’re stumped.
Did the BC have any alternative? Almost certainly not. But, via its literature director, it has chosen to tell us, chillingly, that "There was no disagreement with the Chinese government about the final list of... writers who regularly appear on well-respected lists of the best novelists and poets in China." Indeed. But so do many other Chinese writers - who live not only in exile but also at home, where they may have a vexing relationship with the cultural authorities. That's not to mention the dozens brutally silenced in the courts. At Amnesty International, the Tiananmen Square veteran Shao Jiang has greeted the run-up to the Book Fair with an invaluable day-by-day log of imprisoned Chinese writers: learn their stories at amnesty.org.uk/ blogs/countdown-china.

A big problem in martial arts is as you learn more and more complex sets of skills that build on each other, you hit a wall and try as you might you just can't learn the next set. The problem isn't that the next set of skills is any harder to learn, but any flaws in your basic skills are amplified so much that they drag you down.
I have been thinking and thinking of what my conditions would be and do you know what I dont have any. You see I dont normally like it when people offer Candy but they make you become a follower, I would prefer if people followed me because they like what they see not because they are forced to, does that make sense! However in saying that I would perhaps like this to get out a bit so I am going to leave it up to you as to whether or not you would like to post a pic in your sidebar or not or you may want to do a quick post letting your current followers know that I have some candy. I will not be offended if you do not.

I don’t know about you, but my favorite way to start out the day is with a run outside. For my fellow runners that aren’t aware, this website allows you to input an address and from there, you can map routes for runs, walks, bike rides and just about anything else you want to know! You can even get a map of the elevation changes, calculate calories burned and different types of distances covered. You can save your runs, make friends, find events, and even form groups to fit all your workout needs. I mainly use it to plot out runs each day and it has made it easier for me to switch up my routine so I don’t get bored running by the same house each and every day. So if you don’t use it already, definitely check it out!

Since the annual number of battle-related deaths has decreased proportionally (about 2/3) more than the number of armed conflicts (about 2/5) during 1989-2007, this means that conflicts have on average become around 50% less deadly in terms of annual and direct battle-related deaths. For the period 1950-2007, the average annual battle-related deaths per ongoing conflict has actually decreased by 90%.

Filing a disability claim is NOT as sim­ple as collecting the payout on a lottery ticket. You don’t just send in the claim and the company pays.

Too much is at stake, and the risk of denial or litigation is far too great.

Yet, there are still reminders that we were in the midst of a really hard time. The aftermath of our childcare drama lingers; everything resurfaces any time someone is upset about something; the center feels divided and there’s still a bad taste in my mouth. My husband still has stories of kids who are not doing okay or tricky conversations between faculty. The crisis is over but the effects remain…and will for a while.
Unions and labor regulation play a major role in assuring working conditions, but these are not without their own problems. There are hundreds of cases, from the California Prison unionmembers who earn more than Harvard graduates to railway workers retiring in their 40s and 50s. These abnormally high compensation packages impose a cost on consumers, other industries and the society in which they operate. In this article, I explore how a properly functioning safety net can guarantee labor standards, but at the same time reduce the burden on companies and society.
The US Embassy said the move to focus on Ekneligoda was to add pressure to the Sri Lankan Government to carry out the pursuit of justice in the case of the missing cartoonist, who was abducted and reported missing on 24 January 2010 – two days before the presidential election in which he was a supporter of the defeated candidate former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka.

When Tuesday the 1st rolled around, it was more of a disappointment than surprise to find there would be no show that night! Why - an unknown electrical malfunction had taken the station out of action and off-air for the evening. Technical gremlins, pesky gremlins and variations on the gremlin themes were repeat motifs for the rest of the evening spent in the pub.
﻿Today, surprisingly, was a good day; bitter-sweet, but good. I was able to enjoy myself, reflect and feel the flow of love going in and out of my heart.

Second year- this is when the true managers in us came out. Or at least that’s what we thought! After grueling summer internships there was a mutual understanding in the majority of the batch that the last year of college should be dedicated to ‘fun’, with the placement week being the only exception to the rule! Dependence on medical certificates and wedding invitations increased and students would be seen playing in the field all day long and partying all night long.

This is not just a question of taste. It seems to me that the real purpose of stories and reading is to take you out of yourself and put you somewhere else. Anything that is made to be sold to a particular demographic, however, will always end up reflecting the superficial concerns of that demographic. Exactly: books are for stretching you, growing you, educating you - for adults, too, which is why I've always questioned any publishing marketing philosophy based on the notion of simply catering for an already established need, of which the proposed age-banding is just the latest form. Simon Juden, chief exec of the Publishers Association is being disingenuous when he argues for it as a philanthropic gesture towards children and their parents: 'We don't want a child not to be bought a book as a present because the adult doesn't know where to start'; and it is depressing that critics of the 'No to Age-banding' campaign on the Guardian books blog appear to have swallowed this wholesale and in their clamorous endorsement of such 'help' for parents have revealed a regrettably blinkered - if not I'm-alright-Jack - view of the matter of children and reading:

While the issue of my endorsement did not come up, I certainly have heard from many of you who have weighed in on whether or not I should issue a formal endorsement. Thank you for your counsel, it has been most helpful. However, I felt that it was completely impossible for me to even consider an endorsement until after a meeting to discuss issues critical to those of us who often feel our voices are not heard by the establishment: social conservatives, tea-party supporters, lower and middle income working families.

When he was very small, his parents kept a German shepherd for friends who had to go overseas for a summer.

But that was before parents were spoon-fed fear-mongering media pieces that emphasized the exceptional while ignoring the ordinary. The CDC, in 2001 reported that: "Thirty years ago, the sight of children walking or biking to school was common. In fact, nearly 90% of children who lived within a mile of school used active transportion (i.e., walking or bicycling) as their primary mode of travel. In recent years, the rate of active transport has declined dramatically." By 2005 the CDC reported, "Today, fewer than 15% of children and adolescents use active modes of transportation.

Hermel walked over to the henchman with the brown hair who was still lying bleeding on the floor. His name, by the way, was Bren Wallowcats; a cheat and liar he’d been since his earliest years. Hermel bent down and using his mystic power of 'Earth Healing', put his hands on the man’s wound, and with a stone he’d pulled from a pouch in his pocket in his right hand, invoked the Elkron of the Earth, Minvar, to heal the villain. There seemed a golden glow for a few moments; the man began to breath more evenly, and the blood began to flow less as the gaping gash in his side closed up wherever the stone touched it. He closed his eyes, and thanked Hermel under his breath.
Pours a light orange color with a slight off white head that disappears. A caramel, grainy, toasty smell is apparent. A very sweet caramely taste with a mixture of hoppy bitterness. Has a pretty high avb which is surprising from the taste. I would say it was a medium bodied beer as I had 2 at the end of the night (after pizza) and didn't fill me up completely. Easy to drink 2 or 3.
It pours very lively into the glass, very dark drop with red flashes when held to the light with a thick creamy tan head. Smells roasty with metallic hint, probably due to the can, I prefer bottle for most drinks as I do find the metal from the can does pass on to the smell of the contents. Despite its low abv, this stout has a nice mouth feel and robust malty hit. It isn't as sweet as Left Hand's version though, although Left Hand's beer is over double the abv at 6% so I'm guessing this is lacking the alcohol sweetness.

Truth be told, part of this is probably my fault. Now that I have Wifesy, I find myself putting less and less into my friendships. Well, plainly, because I’m married. However, I know – down in the deepest parts of me – that this is a mistake. A human needs friends. When Wifesy and I were in Scotland, everyone at her school was younger than Wifesy. Way younger, since Wifesy went back to school at 32. So, we hung around with these youngsters, which was fine, but I’m telling you – a 22 year old and a 37 year old, just do NOT have the same philosophical perspective on life. They just don’t. They can have a beer together, but they can not go deep. And I’m one of these bar-talking, gathering-having individuals who likes to go deep with my conversations. When I’m socializing, it’s my raison d etre. I remember I had a bar conversation with a friend of a friend – a Chicago man – who swore to me he was Jesus and by the end of the conversation, he was crying. Now, I understand he was a bit nutty. I know he was a bit much. However, he was such a good conversationalist that by the end of the evening I thought he was one of the best people I’d ever met. I was glad I’d had that conversation. I was glad I had met him. That must’ve been ten years ago and I remember that conversation to this day. Now, I’m not saying I’d want Jesus-man around me everyday – a bit intense, in reality, BUT there was something in his banter that conveyed what he meant. He was trying to say that there was god in all of us, even as he explained it in the most convoluted, yet highly entertaining way. I love someone who can verbally tap dance like that. It’s one of the many reasons why I love comedians, but not comedians who are on all the time. I like the jokey philosophers. I like the Gayles.

I bought the Urban Decay All Nighter Spray in the travel sized, 15ml (.51oz) version for $12, which I would suggest doing to make sure it works for you. The full-sized version (4oz) is priced at $29, but I imagine will last quite a long time. Spring for the travel sized version if you’re only using it for a specific event.

Coming to Australia the stereotyping has gone in the opposite direction. Overtly, the name has regained its authentic connotation. By this I mean the religious meaning. Wherever I go and say my name, an instant question pops up; Hi Abdul, you are Muslim, aren’t you? I always feel taken back by such a question. There are many reasons for that. Firstly, the scepticism that surrounded my name through my early life has denied me the right to be a ‘Muslim’ at least from the perspective of the society in which I grew up. . Secondly, the entrenched secular traditions in my town have made it difficult to think of religion as a way of redemption let alone make me a religious person. Therefore, I always feel I don’t have a clear cut answer to such a question. All I know is that I have never been in a struggle with myself over whether Allah existed or not, nor I am in need of adopting an Islamic identity. However, the question is always striking and confusing although it has became very expected. The answer has never been easy or normal. Till this moment, it takes me some time to get the ‘right’ answer. This usually comes with mumbling and confusion.
Having failed in my attempts to get seasonal beers over Easter, with the sole exception of the mad rabbit one, May brings plenty more opportunities to drink seasonal here in Germany, as breweries turn loose their Maibocks. I have to admit, I didn't even buy any of the below, as they were left as offerings at my door, and one on the lawnmower as a thanks for cutting the grass and getting one of my neighbours out of potential trouble with his significant other. It's nice having a reputation as a beer geek, sometimes.
I give thanks for my curious & fun loving nature.
I really love butterflies and Flourishes has a few stamp sets with them, but I chose the butterfly from the "Butterflies and Blossoms" set. I love the full wings this butterfly has :)
It isn’t all about performing when there isn’t much improvement at the end of the day. I don’t consider myself performing when I’m part of the performance without actually playing confidently and contributing to the success of the performance.

Hey guys! I'm really sorry but this post is going to have to be raw, because there is something wrong with my computer. Whenever I try to run large programs or even sync my iphone, my computer just dies!*** It happens without warning too. I thought it was my battery so I figured I'd wait until a new one shipped but it came in today and its still doing it soooo AHHH. Just try to ignore/forgive any spelling errors or long winded nonsensical rants.
I have a particular affection for the Merlot-Cabernet blends from the Gimblett Gravels area of Hawkes Bay, but Syrah is fast becoming a speciality grape and some other regions are making some super wines too, so experiment – there are many lovely red wines for you to try.

4. While it didn’t happen at the beach, Saarah walked the entire way home! While this may not seem like a big deal, it was the very first time that she wasn’t being pushed, pulled, or carried up the hill from town. She has tiny legs, so it’s quite a feat. She was encouraged by promises of helping make Jell-O when we got home. Tevye was more excited by the fact that he had carried a pine cone the entire way. Wow, Tevye. Your sister accomplishes a huge feat, and you’re excited because you manage to hold on to an object weighing 25grams. Congratu-frigging-lations!

I find it interesting to note that the women featured on the show (MJ, GG, Asa) all come from Muslim families, though they also drink champagne with abandon and none of them is depicted as partaking in any sort of religious practice (with the possible exception of Asa, who considers herself a mystical “intergalactic Persian princess”).
Continuing the festive feel i have made some Christmas inspired bunting for my kitchen! Im quite pleased with how it has turned out. I made it from felt. Just cut the shapes out and then sewed buttons and ribbons on to the trees and gingerbread men and then stitched them on to a length of ribbon. It brightens up a normally dull corner in the kitchen.

Starting on a low heat setting, I ironed my stencil onto the lampshade. The reason the freezer paper sticks, is because the heat from the iron melts the wax on the paper. It’s not going to completely adhere, but just enough so it won’t move around while painting.
It’s also the day after the Taylor’s University Annual Ball where I had returned home at 2.30 am! I know I’m not on top form on this day and I looked and felt completely stoned. Even Levin professes to be fearful of me as I’m not my usual self. However I am only exhausted, not moody.

However, in order to fulfill this calling on our lives it is necessary that we also share in the empowerment that was on Christ when he was in the world. This is the mantle that He passed on to us at Pentecost (cf., “The Double portion Anointing”), this is what the “Promise of the Father” is all about. And, it is in accepting and receiving the Promise of the Father through the baptism of the Spirit that we reclaim the fullness of our spiritual inheritance in Christ (cf., Eph. 1: 16-18).

The fact is that whenever I see successful people, no matter how friendly they are, or how much they try not to “talk shop,” or how kind they are in trying to involve me in the conversation, I never feel completely comfortable, for the simple reason that I am painfully aware that I am not their intellectual equal, nor have I, or can I hope to achieve anything like even a tiny fraction of what they have achieved, and this bothers me.

Cindy M. Hogan graduated with a secondary education teaching degree and enjoys spending time with unpredictable teenagers. More than anything she loves the time she has with her own teenage daughters and wishes she could freeze them at this fun age. If she's not reading or writing, you'll find her snuggled up with the love of her life watching a great movie or planning their next party. She loves to bake, garden and be outdoors doing a myriad of activities.

The highlight of my time in Washington was when my boss at work wanted to form a rifle team. We competed with any team we could find (even high school boys). Then a group of four or five of us started competing at civilian rifle matches up and down the east coast from Pennsylvania to North Carolina.

Taking a look at my recent output it's hard to imagine I once was a prolific blogger. And truth of the matter is I've had plenty of things I wanted to share with you but sadly I'm not allowed to. Not yet anyway, so I've been going with the philosophy it's better to say nothing at all than to risk saying too much.

We charged the village and your noble samurai easily routed the bandits there, saved the children, saved the peasants, saved the Yasuki hostage, and even saved the livestock. That act alone would have been enough to ensure that from now on, the peasants of Red Falls will speak of the Paper Lanterns in hushed and reverential tones (as they well should anyway!) but oh no, that wasn’t enough for your mighty men (and one terrifying woman). They decided that they would stay, fortify the village, and defeat all the bandits. Truly, such courage is only possible when inspired by Goemon, Fortune of Courage, or perhaps the example set by men such as Ide Todo.

Jessie wants to play hockey, eventually making it to the NHL. It's not a problem per se, but it will be a battle because Jessie is growing up in the 1960s and there was only one Black professional hockey player at this time, Willie O'Ree for him to look up to. Jessie is offered the opportunity to attend a prestigious New Hampshire boarding school on a full scholarship and the chance to play on the school's hockey team. Best case scenario Jessie hopes he will get spotted by scouts and be on his way to the NHL after a grand college career, worst case scenario, Jessie plays for one of the best high school hockey teams in the country and attends a top college. He sees this situation as a win-win and although his parents have some serious misgivings, they ultimately agree. Unfortunately, Jessie expected some racism but he is shocked by the racism he faces from 99% of his teammates, he expected his teammates to come around when he showed his skills. Jessie does not want to throw in the towel, but he's not sure he wants to spend four years of his life being miserable, and not given playing time by his hockey coach.

As I cook the risotto, I will add the veg paste and maybe a drop or two of cream. The remainder of the cooked veg will go into the risotto when it is almost finished. Some Parmesan Romano on top, salt and pepper and it's done. Maybe some grated lemon, also.
Without any kind of conscious control over my actions, and relying purely on instinct/adrenaline, I grabbed Shane’s tiny body and flung her clear across the condo. She must have flown ten feet into the kitchen area. I believe she landed hard against the entertainment center.
There must have been one, some time, some warning, some leading; something. There was the time in the time I asked the sky but perhaps my own body covered in blood dying couldn’t be worthy to be seen or tolerated. There was the ominous voice but most certainly not divine. There was assuredly the moment when my mother had driven away in the night. I was only a small child and crying I had no idea what to do in the dark duplex building on Insley. Wailing something told me it would be alright. I would be safe; such peace that I stopped crying to move into the darkness unafraid wondering how to pass the minutes.

Let me say right off the bat that this is predictable territory. Nothing new here. A woman is looking for Mr. Right and discovers before it's too late that he was right under her nose the whole time. It's been done to death, and you know it as soon as "the hunky new neighbor" walks in the door. Yawn.
When it comes to individual and team development, do you find it constantly carried over on your to-do list? Developing team members can be something you do each and every day.

Perhaps it is for later theologians and scholars to build on the foundation Calvin laid for an orderly kind of worship that he would not have been able to see clearly through his own cultural lens. If Calvin, in his context, could make concessions on a temporary basis, perhaps he has paved the way for more permanent changes in today’s context.

“I believe Scenario #5 best addresses the criteria detailed in the School Boundary Review Procedure and as prioritized by the Boundary Review Committee,” says David Euale, Director of Education for the Halton District School Board. “Fundamentally Scenario #5 sees the new school as a community school striving to serve the needs of the students in the area in which the school is built.”
Oh My Gosh, Dawn!! You got to stay at the same place Rosie O'Donnell used to have her guests on her show stay. Did you at least get to do a little bit of quik shopping?!
I haven’t seen a picture of me over the age of 9 months or under the age of 18 for 30 years. Anyway I called my dad last week and asked him to copy some pictures since I knew he had a ton, and he had all of grandma’s pictures too.
Overall it was the perfect finish because I was able to get it together quickly and efficiently. I sort of wish I'd used this same technique for the 365 quilt, but it's a bit late now.

The biggest problem, other than lack of variety and volume, was the strawberry shake. First of all, these aren’t shakes. The chocolate “shake” is much more like chocolate milk. The strawberry drink has a flavor that makes me think of drinking a cup of Amoxicillin or some other flavored liquid medicine! Unfortunately, not only do I have a strawberry drink a day all this week, but I ordered seven more for next week. Hopefully I can get through those, but I won’t be ordering any more. The vanilla (on a taste test) tasted like playdough to me, so guess I’ll be living on the chocolate. (And the chicken soup tasted toxic. Good thing I like the tomato soup.)

Start with our recipe for Vanilla Buttercream Frosting (page L4) or another white frosting. Mix in food coloring a drop at a time to achieve anything from a delicate pastel to vivid color. Kitchen specialty stores and baking supply stores often have a range of colors beyond what you'll find at the supermarket, and of course you can mix colorings to make your own tint. Gel and paste food colorings are more intense than liquid versions.
The rest of the home is just as carefully planned.
Yet the food DePersio serves at Fascino is nothing like the familiar Italian food at so many Jersey restaurants. This food is lighter, and it's not just that the heavy sauces are gone. This is a European renaissance. DePersio brings French techniques to Italian food, and the result is something elemental and transcendent, with a gnocchi, for example, that seems to defy the laws of physics. Perhaps this is what DePersio meant when he named the place -- you will be fascinated by his ability to take a basic dish and elevate it to an ethereal version of itself.
"We dug too deep of a hole," Rams coach Matt Hixenbaugh said. "They came out ready to play and jumped all over us. We battled and hung around, but they're a really good team and you can't give them a cushion like we did in the first three minutes of the game."
But as a personnel evaluator, John Elway is about impact players, about speed, about taking the best player available when the team's pick rolls around, regardless of position. And truth be told, the best teams in the draft year after year hold to that philosophy.

Yet another answer is that the figures may not be quite so high as they seem. Full employment here means 7 percent are out of work, and some economist estimate it may really be 10 percent, given the number of people who call themselves unemployed in order to collect compensation.
However, an Iranian bomb is not just a threat to Israel. It could destabilize the entire region and lead to a new arms race, and that's not in the best interests of the United States, Europe, Russia, China or anyone else. On this point, there's no daylight between the Obama and Netanyahu governments, nor is there any disagreement that it is unlikely that a nuclear-armed Iran could be contained through a traditional policy of deterrence.
A few months before his November 2007 serve-out date, while stationed at Fort Drum, N.Y., Miller learned that he had been "Stop-Loss'd" — meaning he would remain with his unit for a third deployment. He walked away twice, for a total of 19 months.

At the time, I thought this may never happen again in my lifetime. To be at the clinching game for the playoffs. People who were strangers before the game became friends. In Cleveland, many people know where they were the night the Indians clinched. They were either at the game or watching it on TV.

The veteran rock guitarist isn’t above indulging in mid-Eighties lite-metal cliché. He still likes to punctuate verses with single, quavering, overdriven high notes. But on Wednesday night, his leads were particularly lyrical: his spotlight moment on “Wanted Dead Or Alive” demonstrated everything Sambora does well. He can still crash into a song like a stallion kicking down a barn door. When he slows down – which, admittedly, isn’t too often – his solos can be melodic, soaring, cathartic.

It reached a pitch last week at the Verdi Club in San Francisco's Mission District, where a sold-out crowd of 300 people greeted Strayed's unveiling as Sugar with a standing ovation. She was preceded onstage by musicians, a comedian and seven "women of The Rumpus" who wore fishnet stockings and orange gloves with "Hell's" on one hand and "Bells" on the other. They read questions and answers from columns by Steve Almond, who originated the "Dear Sugar" column in The Rumpus before passing it on to Strayed. Almond wrote "Dear Sugar" in the persona of a woman who had been around the block a few times and wasn't above a snarky response. Strayed, he says, took a more nurturing approach and turned the sometimes-reflexive hostility of the Web into a community of supporters.

That's what is being whispered in the ear of every player who comes to the par-5 seventh hole at Big Met in Fairview Park. Do you belt the drive 240 or more yards around the trees, challenge a drainage area and set up for a mid-iron approach and a likely birdie?

His trial on assorted violations of campaign finance law is, perhaps, not the ideal venue for him to spill the beans about his misdeeds on behalf of Democratic candidates — in that context, he's not exactly a reliable witness. But if he has proof that he or others have broken the law on behalf of Democrats, Republicans or anyone else, the public (and prosecutors) would surely love to see it.
It's strange to think that for nearly 11 full years, Seton Hall — a program that has gone to two NCAA Tournaments in the time frame — had gone unranked in the Associated Press poll. But coming into Tuesday night's game against DePaul, the Pirates had gone 332 games between their last game as a ranked team (a 70-64 loss at home to Rutgers). Even though the last AP Poll featuring Seton Hall appeared on Jan. 30, 2001, the Pirates played two games before falling out of the poll for good.

ANSWER: Wisdom teeth (third molars) were necessary eons ago when humans had a coarser diet and larger jaws. With evolution, our jaws have gotten relatively smaller and, in many cases, there isn't enough room for them to erupt fully or into a favorable position. Often, these teeth will only partially erupt, leaving a flap of tissue over a portion of the crown of the tooth. Food and bacteria get under this flap and cause an infection. Even if the teeth fully erupt, they are so far back in the mouth that it is difficult to keep them and the surrounding gums clean and healthy.

For Huntington, which reported a profitable first quarter, the deal provides a tax benefit and a way to invest in communities. Affordable-housing developers rely on grants, loans, tax credits and subsidies to make low monthly rents possible at new apartments and renovated properties. Developers who obtain tax credits through the Ohio Housing Finance Agency, and comparable housing groups in other states, sell those credits to raise money for their projects. The buyers are banks and other businesses that can use the credits to offset what they owe in taxes.

Rep. Zachary Wyatt, a 27-year-old cattle farmer from the rural northern Missouri town of Novinger, said the legislation had motivated him to disclose his sexual orientation publicly for the first time.

"We let them decide. We gave them the whole menu. Most of the dishes are variations of things we are accustomed to for a big event. When you think of a big meal, you include a carving of roast beef, for example," he said.
Cook isn't the only Vikings player trying to prove himself this week. Newly signed receiver Jerome Simpson will be suspended for the first three games of next season after he pleaded guilty in April to a felony charge after authorities said 2 pounds of marijuana were shipped to his Kentucky home last year. Simpson was sentenced to 15 days in jail, 200 hours of community service and fined $7,500.
We have also had to adapt to working with less staff and fewer resources. Yet politicians would point the finger of blame at us and our unions with one hand while handing out tax breaks to big businesses with the other. We refuse to be the governor's scapegoats and allow him to take the focus away from what really matters to the people of Ohio: creating jobs, allowing us to make a livable wage to take care of our families, and being treated with dignity and respect.
An Ocean Township man was indicted today on charges he made and sold fake Social Security and U.S. permanent resident cards from his home, officials said.

At issue in City Attorney Dennis Herrera's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, is the performance of the little-known U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

Further, Clemens' angry denials of the allegations in the Mitchell Report forced Congress to question whether the report had fulfilled Congress's intention that it be the "final word" on baseball's drug problems.
But this is where the comparisons differ. No one found Woods' golf ball at the Wells Fargo Championship. The evidence official Mark Russell had when making the ruling pointed toward a stolen ball, and the wide-open area of trampled pine straw (along with the nature of the trees) supported that.
On Nov. 13, Wilkins, 17, was shot in the back in her home as she ran away from gunfire outside in the Ville neighborhood. She was nearly to her bedroom, police said, when a bullet fired across the street caught up to her. Police do not believe she was an intended target. No arrests have been made.

I love mocking, which is why I have produced five first-round mock drafts in the past two months (and it’s why I have greeted your criticism of said mock drafts with an aw-shucks shrug of the shoulders). In my latest first-round mock, which was released Tuesday night, I had the Ravens selecting Alabama linebacker Dont’a Hightower with the 29th pick in the NFL draft. Why stop there? How about I project all eight of their picks?

The evidence suggests otherwise, and the country would do well to consider a new direction. Immigrants, legal or otherwise, act for rational reasons. Mexico's birth rate has dropped and its economy is expanding. Increased border security and sanctions against hiring have made a difference.

The Wall Street Journal has us cringing. A recent article ("Tight Ties, Killer Heels: Clothes Make the Fashion Victim") warned that our clothing is causing real damage - to something other than our bank accounts.
That fact about the Brownie I mentioned above appears at least three times in captions. There is talk of George Eastman; there is talk of the other photographers who rushed to the scene, and what they did, and yadda yadda. God knows, I love dead unknown photographers as much as the next guy, but the San Francisco Earthquake and Fire of 1906 was not about photography. It was about about the largest city on the Pacific Coast brought to its knees. So the show isn't about photographs, whatever the curator thinks; it's about the content of the photographs.
TRENTON — It took about two minutes from the time Senate President Steve Sweeney certified the passage of the millionaires tax package for Gov. Chris Christie to veto the bills at his desk. "While I have little doubt that the sponsors and supporters of this bill sincerely believe that the state can tax its way out of this financial crisis, I believe that this bill does nothing more than repeat the failed, irresponsible and unsustainable fiscal policies of the past," wrote Christie in his veto statement. "Now is not the time for more of the same. Ultimately, another tax increase will punish the state’s struggling small businesses and set our economy further back from recovery."

As a longtime visitor to the North Shore in the winter, I had seen surf wondrously big and disappointingly small. But December 2009 would be different. A massive storm plowing 7,000 miles across the Pacific was throwing off waves the size of four-story apartment buildings. It would climax with what Surfer magazine dubbed "The Day of the Decade."

The former Massachusetts governor struggled through a prolonged primary this winter and spring, fending off challenges from the right, particularly in Southern states.

Four other clients told similar stories: Ellis' franchise agreement estimated the total investment at $236,000 to $346,000. But opening a spa cost as much as $500,000 and took as long as a year. And once Ellis had their money, he rarely returned calls.
"While most New Jerseyans are struggling to meet mortgage payments and provide even the most basic needs for their families, there were law enforcement officers purchasing steroids on the taxpayer’s dime," Turner said in a statement.

No, seriously, that’s what he called himself in a YouTube video he posted on Tuesday when he said the resident Giant back flipper Jason Pierre-Paul is a “great athlete but I’m one, too.” Wilson then proceeded to beat Pierre-Paul’s back-flip count by a touchdown’s worth, 21-14.
President Obama has pledged to begin the withdrawal of American troops in July 2011 and to complete the transition to Afghan-led forces by the end of 2014. Most observers predict that the first troop reduction will be little more than a token gesture. That moves the debate to whether maintaining a major troop presence in Afghanistan for an additional two and a half years can achieve our stated goals and, even if it can, whether it is worth the additional cost in American lives and treasure.

Google's Street View has received widespread criticism from the start, especially in Europe.

The memorial under construction at a Gloucester Township park is a tribute to Schultz, a 3 1/2-year-old German Shepherd who was thrown into traffic on Route 42 in November 2010 while trying to help his police handler subdue a robbery suspect.

Like "The Lord of the Rings," C.S. Lewis' "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" was the product of a Great Britain that had just been through a war of survival. The story neither was about World War II, nor was it an allegory for it, and yet it was informed by the moral absolutes and challenges of the wartime period: There's the presence of darkest evil, which can't be avoided but must be faced head-on. There's the grim understanding that sacrifice is necessary, that whole worlds are riding on the actions of a handful of individuals. And, in the presence of a wickedness so complete as to be supernatural, there's faith in absolute goodness.
Unless those combined 400 or so employees find work at other Best Buy stores, perhaps at one of the new "mobile, small format" stores the company says it intends to open, they probably will be added to those cities' already swollen jobless numbers.

The Universal grinder was first designed in 1897, at which time it transformed the work of the cook by easing the effort required to chop meats and vegetables. The simple machine could grind 21/2 pounds of meat per minute, depending on the agility of the person turning the handle. It was nothing short of a marvel -- a food processor for the 19th century.
Radcliff said the most recent survey of visitors to the county (in 2009) showed that more than 20,000 visiting golfers who had responded to visitors bureau marketing efforts had spent more than $6 million -- a conservative figure that did not include other visitors who came to play on their own.

The poor play, along with the league's second-highest goalkeeper salary at $200,000 (Seattle's Kasey Keller earned $300,000) last season, prompted D.C. United to move Perkins. Perkins wasn't helped by the terrible team play, with D.C. United finishing the season with the worst record in MLS and a goal differential of minus-25, by far the league's worst.

As much as at any time this season, Roy lacked explosiveness and athleticism and finished with just four points. In a down-to-the-wire fourth quarter, Roy played just 4:42. So when the Blazers returned to Portland, Roy met with coach Nate McMillan, the Blazers’ training staff and general manager Rich Cho, and the group decided sitting out the Blazers’ upcoming three-game home stand was the best course of action for Roy.

The pope "will visit a country that has been praised the world over for its hospitality and the good cheer of its inhabitants," the archdiocese of Mexico said in a published editorial.

In a December lease agreement, the county spells out minimum benchmarks for its private partner, requiring Chicago-based MMPI to host 43 exhibit hall events and 72 meetings or banquets in other parts of the facility. By its seventh year, the convention center must be 35 percent occupied, bring in 214,500 attendees (in- or out-of-town) and generate 33,000 hotel room stays. By MMPI's calculations, that could mean $708 million a year in total impact.

The chief sponsor, Republican Steve Cookson of southeast Missouri, a retired school superintendent, no less, told a local television station that his bill has been misunderstood, and he only wanted to shift the discussion of sexuality from schools to the home.

If the city were to survive, the civic and business leaders said, it had to be rebuilt where it had stood. There was no time to plan grand boulevards, much less build them.

In his acceptance speech for the Ohioana Award, Condon wrote, "What I oppose is the hushed, carpeted fearful approach to history and those who made history. There is the air of the funeral parlor in most of our history books, and perhaps the sound of some rinky-tink piano is what we need to break the sad spell and bring history to its feet again. Only in life is there any hope for history."
McGehee also transformed her master bath by turning his-and-hers closets into a walk-in limestone shower and a closed water closet.

In September Swanson wrote a letter to Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and U.S. Associate Attorney General Thomas Perrelli, saying that any multistate foreclosure settlement should have "teeth." Any settlement shouldn't release banks from liability for conduct that hasn't been investigated and shouldn't compromise the due process rights of any individual citizens, she said.

Are you out of your mind? It's $377 million!
I am also a former state representative, and once received a more-than-generous General Assembly per diem, so I know that per diem money is used to pad a legislator's salary. It does not cost $183 a day to travel to Denver and live for 120 days. If that amount is annualized, it is nearly $67,000 a year in compensation solely for room, board and transportation. That amount is about $20,000 a year higher than Colorado's average salary, and it is per diem, not salary.
The actor who's known for the game "Six Degrees" is now separated from an all-important item - his Blackberry!
In a black dress, small studs in her ears and a bare face, the actress was called to testify about the last time she saw her family alive. They gathered in her Chicago home. Her mother and brother flanked her as she played the piano, her nephew hunkered in a corner reading a book. Even her brother's dog, Dreamgirl, joined them, Jennifer Hudson said, tears in her eyes: "It was us being family."

CTU and Jackson had planned to meet after Easter, both sides said yesterday, but they have called a meeting at 7 p.m. tonight at City Hall.

The state's defense, and it has been around the block in other cases, is that one General Assembly (which sits for two years, beginning in the January of every odd-numbered year) can't bind the next General Assembly. So, for example, the 2009-10 legislature (the current one) can't necessarily require the 2011-12 legislature to do anything (as Ohio school spenders are about to find out).

“It really allows you to focus on yourself, not so much prep work for the other team,” the Glen Burnie native and Old Mill graduate said. “We had two stretches where we went through three games in seven or eight days, and we really just focused on ourselves and executed and sharpened some things up and then not as much personnel work for the other team. We really focused on ourselves. So I think that plays to our strengths at times because we know how good we can be and if we just perfect the things we need to do, I think we can beat anybody we need to. So in terms of playing Denver on Wednesday, we’re going to come to work on Monday, we’re going to watch the game, we’re going to correct some things and then we’re going to get after it in practice on Monday.”
Obama should stop "campaigning" and start "doing." - Tom Tyschper, Phoenix
One of the concerns I have with this revitalized economy is to make sure that we have the education and training available to train people for these new jobs -- including older workers.

Sports Illustrated released a story on Monday night that said as many as 28 players over eight years were involved with trading memorabilia for tattoos or money.

Not that you could ever fall. Riders are harnessed and tethered much like zip-liners. But it's more comfortable, with the straps not riding up as much in the seated position. In one shady spot, I stopped pedaling and just dangled for a while. The cycle gently swayed, and it was very quiet without constant noise of the chain. It would have passed as a decent hammock.

Seriously, if the night is about honoring the movies, why are the people we're honoring most being kept off-screen? You think viewers would rather have a lame production number than see James Earl Jones talk about his long and amazing career?
Hatfield declined to talk about the details of the murder case for fear of compromising the prosecution. But authorities have said the marriage was troubled, and that the couple had been fighting on the morning that Winkler told a neighbor that his wife was dead.

"I don't think ever since I've been a head coach, and I guess that's 12 years now, I've been like, 'Man, we're going to win Meramec,'" Walsh said. "It's just too hard to win it.

It's still kind of mind-blowing."

A special cocktail selection (all $8) is as intriguing as the food menu, but the results are mixed. The idea of a Hot Tomato is good -- a deconstructed bloody Mary with vodka, tomato water, lemon and a dash of Tabasco served in a martini glass with a jalapeno pepper floating in the middle. However, the drink tasted flat. I asked for salt to perk it up, which helped to coax out the sweetness in the fruit.

God bless Stacey King - I couldn't have made it through the season without him. He's the color commentator for Comcast SportsNet, with a litany of Harry Caray-esque exclamations - "get me the hot sauce" and "too strong, too fast, too good" and such - that keep the whole thing fun, with a nod to his straight man, Neil Funk, the play-by-play announcer. I miss them when they're not on.
Security guards called police.
Maybe it's North Carolina defensive end Quinton Coples. Or defensive tackles Fletcher Cox of Mississippi State or Michael Brockers of LSU.

Auditioning for Ocasio's clown corps made Jannott nervous. He had collected over the years a few trinkets of the trade and showed up with a lapel flower that squirts water, a baseball cap with a whirligig on top, a real flower stuck in a straw. For his audition, he persuaded a female judge to reach for the flower -- only to find it stuck in the straw.

Given the apparent popularity among voters of laws such as the Legal Arizona Workers Act, which created employer sanctions for hiring illegal immigrants, and SB 1070, the state's controversial immigration law, why raise these concerns? Simply put, experience and empirical research show laws like these have not worked well anywhere they've been tried. By "worked," I mean in terms of outcomes, costs and impacts.

The $3.5 trillion spending plan the House budget chairman released Tuesday morning is a great deal like what Mr. Ryan and his tea-party-endorsed colleagues in the House offered last year — with a bit less detail in areas that got him and his party in so much trouble last year, like cuts in Medicare benefits for senior citizens.
He's also been growing marigolds for years. In the fall when they finish blooming, he pinches off the flowers and puts them in a paper grocery bag to dry out. In the early spring, he pulverizes the old flowers by hand to get the seeds out of them.
"Last year at (Southwestern) conference I was running the mile and I pulled a muscle in my right foot," Mink said.

Of course, good skyscraper design isn't all about height, and there are growing signs that U.S architecture is moving upward with some confidence. Frank Gehry's fledgling new residential tower in Manhattan's financial district isn't Goliath, but it's 76 stories of optimistic twists and thrusts never seen before. Also rising: Freedom Tower, or 1 WTC, on the old World Trade Center site — a 1,776-foot statement that America will keep on keeping on.
Banks that made reckless home loans have been tiptoeing away from foreclosures in a tactic designed to cut their losses. The result: Orphaned, dilapidated homes dot the landscape from Kendall to Lake Worth.

Over the past several months, Mitt Romney has been an excellent presidential candidate. He has performed superbly in the debates. He has outorganized his rivals.

Prof. Quinn and Andrew Martin of Washington University's law school used the time-machine techniques to track judges' ideological evolution and compare them to each other. The researchers were trying to identify where on the political spectrum, for each case, the judges and possible verdicts would lie. Then they would use that information to estimate the probability of how each judge would vote in each case. In that way, they used judges' past votes to construct a numerical model of probabilities that they could then apply to cases the judges never heard.

It's a Darwinian view. Having lived nearly all of his 64 years within the patrician bubble, or the bubble of high finance, Romney's idea of the common touch is to debate with his aides whether the pair of jeans he's about to don should be Levis or Gap 1969s. That's pretty funny.
It was never that simple, because the NFL plans on being doggedly protective of the LA market and will tightly control the process of putting a team there. The price on the Dodgers' sale only reinforced how valuable a LA-based NFL franchise would be for the owner, and the league isn't just going to allow anyone to sweep in and cash in. That's obvious, but the reality did nothing to prevent the paranoia from festering in St. Louis.

The Cardinal (Todd Van Voris) and Ferdinand (Jake Street) want their recently widowed sister, the idolized Duchess (Sara Catherine Wheatley) to remain unmarried. They hire a well-meaning security guard, Antonio (Vin Shambry) to keep watch over her. The Duchess, however, falls in love and surreptitiously marries Antonio. All is well until the brothers discover her deceit. The Cardinal has the Duchess secretly carried off, imprisoned and tortured by Bosola (Chris Murray). Webster's Duchess rises above her seemingly necessary dishonesty to become the heroic martyr who defiantly announces "I am the Duchess of Malfi still" as she faces death; likewise Fisher's Duchess maintains her dignity and refuses to surrender either her identity or her title.

A: Honda says it is not planning to develop a direct replacement for the Element. However, the car maker has been guiding fans of the discontinued vehicle to its new CR-V compact crossover.

There was a push to move him out in 2004 but it failed.

Standing from quite literally the heights of basketball glory, you are reminded that the struggle of a hall-of-famer — surely one of days, hours, and years spent trying to learn and understand the game, of hard lessons learned both on and off the court — is shared by all lifetime basketball-lovers. In this sense, the Honors Ring spotlights the people who best represent, not own, the game's legacy.
Subsequent San Francisco building code overhauls in 1939, 1956, 1975, 1984, 1990 and 1992 greatly advanced building and fire safety. And even though a San Francisco program mandated strengthening of unreinforced masonry, or URM, buildings in 1986, which has worked through about 90 percent of the city's nearly 2,000 brick buildings, legacies of the 1906 quake and fire remain. There are still thousands of hastily rebuilt unreinforced masonry buildings cheek-by-jowl with wooden structures with no fire-resistant walls between them.

Here were highly sophisticated conservative thinkers - lawyers and justices - making the case for limited government, and liberals weren't even prepared for the obvious constitutional question: If Congress can force the individual into a private contract by authority of the Commerce Clause, what can it not force the individual to do? Without a limiting principle, the central premise of our constitutional system - a government of enumerated powers - evaporates. What then is the limiting principle?

When Claiborne came out of high school, the schools that recruited him knew he had a learning disability. I don’t know much about his disability other than it has to do with reading. Everyone I have talked to tells me that Claiborne has great character and is a great kid. He knows and understands his disability and uses all the resources that LSU has available to control it and to help him get by in the classroom. When it comes to football he puts in extra time to learn and understand his assignments and it is not a problem. Will he need reps? Probably, but no more than the usual rookie would need.

She told him that all he could do was set his alarm every morning and show up for the game.

Will win: Perry is out of her league. And as much as I admire Lady Gaga, "The Fame Monster" really amounts to a glorified EP.

“In a nutshell, its been co-opted by the industry, so on one hand they have some mission of only supporting ‘independent’ stores, but then the bulk of releases are overpriced crap from major labels - the same ones that tried to destroy indie stores back when they had any power in the 1990s,” Steinhardt says. “On top of that, I think the collector culture of vinyl is really dangerous for the longevity of the format. So while this day claims to be celebrating the format, by being all about limited ephemera and not about music, it’s rapidly speeding up the music industry’s demise.”

Chaos is too strong a word, but confusion abounds in the realm of animal control in the city of St. Louis.

Harrell, a good-hitting pitcher, singled with out in the second and Schafer grounded hard to Craig, who made a good stop at his knees but fired over the head of shortstop Furcal. Craig had thrown wide of Furcal on a similar play earlier in the week.
Cleveland business owner Alexandria Johnson Boone didn't need figures to persuade her to do something.
